Senator Barack Obama has won the race to become the nominee of the Democratic Party in the United States of America.  Today, Hilary Clinton threw her weight behind him:
<blockquote>
"Today as I suspend my campaign, I congratulate him on the victory he has won and the extraordinary campaign he has won," Mrs Clinton said.  "I endorse him and throw my full support behind him and I ask of you to join me in working as hard for Barack Obama as you have for me." 
</blockquote>
I can't really tell you why I'm so hopeful for Obama.  Maybe it's because people I really respect have <a href="http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/01/28/obama/">come out and endorsed him</a> - several times - breaking their usual non-political stances in several instances.  But I've read about him, and I've watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrp-v2tHaDo">his speeches</a> (<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/18/obama.transcript/">transcript here</a>), and I'm optimistic about where America is going.

America, so unwell, but still able to thrill us when you get it right...
