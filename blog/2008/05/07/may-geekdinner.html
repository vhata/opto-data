As I <a href="http://lists.geekdinner.org.za/pipermail/geekdinner-announce/2008-May/000015.html">said</a> on the <a href="http://lists.geekdinner.org.za/mailman/listinfo/geekdinner-announce">GeekDinner announcement list</a>: 
</p>
<p>
Since the <a href="http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Cape_Town_March_2008">last GeekDinner</a> was held at the end of March, and since we hold the <a href="http://www.geekdinner.org.za/">GeekDinners</a> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bimestrial">bimestrially</a>, it seems we are due another one at  the end of May.  This is the eightthhth GeekDinner, and we're calling  
it "<a href="http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Cape_Town_May_2008">Happy Habanero</a>".  What with the habanero being the national  
vegetable of Azerbaijan, we're going to hold the dinner on  
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_Day#May_28_in_Armenia_and_Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan's Republic Day</a>, which, according to wikipedia, is  
Wednesday, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_28">May 28th</a>.
</p>
<p>
The venue for this dinner is Mel's Kitchen, in Rondebosch Village, just <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-33.95321&mlon=18.48881&zoom=17&layers=B0FT">off Klipfontein Road</a>.

We're now in our second year of GeekDinners, and they seem to be going strong.  We have a good model, mostly sustainable, although it is slightly dependent on the core group of organisers to get things moving.  We have a solid set of regular attendees that should provide the dinners with enough momentum to continue, though, should anything happen, and I'm very positive about the future of the dinners.  We're also managing, for the most part, to keep talks short and interesting to <b>all comers</b> - I know that newcomers always worry that everything's going to be "too hardcore techie", but honestly, it's not about microchips and "ones and zeroes".  My favourite talks have been about <a href="http://www.greenman.co.za/">hippies</a> and <a href="http://www.yeahfi.com/">the buttons on car radios</a>.  So, please, if you haven't been before, why not come along, meet some new people, share some <a href="http://www.perdeberg.co.za/">free wine</a>, and enjoy some <a href="http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Cape_Town_May_2008#Menu">excellent food</a>.

The slideshow karaoke has become a regular feature of our dinners, and is always one of the most entertaining parts.  The way it works is, somebody prepares a set of slides on any topic they want (we've had <i>"Etiquette when dealing with British Royalty"</i>, <i>"Common problems with cement tiles"</i>, and <i>"A primer on lesser known Norse gods"</i>).  Somebody else then presents a talk based on these slides without any prior knowledge of the topic, or of the content of the slides - always to amusing effect.  This time, <a href="http://whijo.net/brad">Darb</a> is preparing the slides, and we have yet to find a volunteer to present them.  If you're keen, do volunteer.  If not, maybe you have something interesting you'd like to talk about anyway - we have no volunteers for speakers yet.
