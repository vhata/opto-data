If you have any spare clothes (and I know you do), or any spare cash (and I know you do), please, PLEASE, help out. There are thousands of people left with no homes, and nothing possessions but what they're wearing.  Most supermarkets should have donation boxes, but for more ideas of how to help, check out the <a href="http://www.tac.org.za/helpnow">Treatment Action Campaign</a> site, and there's even a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=18325061260">facebook group</a> for you.

Thanks.
