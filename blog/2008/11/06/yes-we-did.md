You've all heard by now.  I hope you watched (or at least read the transcripts of) Obama's [victory speech][vicspeech], and McCain's [concession speech][conspeech] - they are both very moving, and McCain's especially highlights his dignity and grace in defeat - attributes that not a few commenters have pointed out might have gained him more votes than the silly political shenanigans he thought he was forced to play during the campaign.

I don't have much to add to the "Yay Obama won" posts that are already clogging up the blagospherimoboweb, but I do have one or two thoughts.

Firstly, although America did well to vote the big guy in, that choice was an obvious one - it was almost impossible to screw *that* up.  There were some other decisions that needed making, perhaps not as obvious to them, or maybe just not as publicly discussed.  Running a quick eye down the [ballot measures][] should make it clear that America may have chosen the rock star to lead them, but they still need to do some hard thinking about what freedom really means. (Also, way to take a firm grasp of the issues that matter, Maryland.)  I think Antoine van Gelder's usual succinctness puts it best about [the presidential elections][antpass] and [proposition 8][antfail].

Secondly, in watching the coverage of the election results, there was a rather disturbing amount of [bile and vitriol][nigpres] forthcoming from McCain supporters, who didn't heed their candidate's plea to unite behind their new President-Elect. They lost no time in putting [this little gem][obamaimpeach] up, for instance. And for the first time, the bigots hate more than just their president(-elect)'s policies, which makes me worried that they might take more drastic action this time round (instead of just sinking back into apathy as they've always done before).  And things likes [this][assobama] don't assuage those fears.  Well, roll on January 20th - we'll see where we go.

Now, let's [turn our eyes inwards][sadec].
