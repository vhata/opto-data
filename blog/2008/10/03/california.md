This is what my [music history][] on [last.fm][] currently looks like:

![Music History][musichist]

[Once again][2005trip], I am off to California.  [My company][synthasite] is flying over the eight employees in the Cape Town office who are not already there, so that we can have the whole company together in one place for some training, meetings, and a "year-end" party, before it gets any bigger.

I'll be leaving tomorrow, the <del>3rd</del><ins>4th</ins> of October, and coming back on the 22nd.  My birthday is on the 12th, which is Columbus Day (the day Christopher first sighted America), a public holiday in the US, so I'll get a nice long weekend while I'm there. I had a look for some events that are going on while I'm there, although I didn't find many that [appealed to me][spanking].  [Neil][] and I will be [visiting some local geeks][nxsypost] at the [Python User Group][pug] and the [Linux User Group][sflug], for a start.  I also noticed that the Kings of Leon are [playing][kol] while I'm there, as well as... believe it or not...  Well, [have a look][nkotb].

If you have any other suggestions for things to do while we're there, let me know.  I'm keen to head out of down, do some [wine tasting][maddox], and maybe even head to [Yosemite][].

California, here we come!
