<p>My sister and I went to Camps Bay for the afternoon. It was extremely windy, and we both got thoroughly exfoliated, but at the end of it, we had this magnificent sunset as a reward. I don't think there's a prettier beach in the world than our west coast.</p><p><a href="/files/2008/04/20/DSC00062.jpg"><img src="/files/2008/04/20/DSC00062-thumb.jpg" alt="phoblogged image" title="phoblogged image" /></a>
