Next year, I'm thinking that Stellenbosch is a good option for me.  The town, not the university. It's a beautiful place, and it's smallish (I do well in small towns, it seems), but it's still right close to Cape Town.  Ivan says he can find me jobs there easy-peasy, although a big problem is going to be my citizenship - I need a work permit or a South African passport.

Even if Stellenbosch doesn't pan out, Cape Town might be a good place.  It's a haven for coders and developers (apparently) and they get paid well.  And I know people there.  And <a href="http://www.xanga.com/carxmoss">Claire</a>, bless her cotton knickers, says she'll drive me round to interviews in December if I apply for jobs now.  So that'd be good.  Anyway, we shall see.

I have put my "resume" up on <a href="http://www.careerjunction.co.za/">Career Junction</a> but the site looks really crappy - they ask stupid questions that aren't relevant to me, and don't seem to be about what I want at all.  Anyway, it's a start.
