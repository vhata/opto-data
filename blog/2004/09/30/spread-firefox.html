<p>Everybody else was doing it.</p>

<p>This is where I do my bit to <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/">spread Firefox</a> (makes it sound like a sandwich filling or a venereal disease). Details on exactly why Firefox is the bestest browser out there can be found at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">the Firefox homepage</a>.  However, if you don't want to read all that, I think this excerpt from an IM conversation I had with my sister should convince you:
</p>
<pre>
13:16 <Vhata> (13:07:52) Vhata: why didn't you like mozilla?
13:16 <Vhata> (13:08:05) Bex: It had a funny dinosaur icon
And then later:
17:05 <Vhata> (17:04:09) Bex: I downloaded Mozilla Firefox
17:05 <Vhata> (17:04:16) Bex: it's good hey
17:05 <Vhata> (17:04:31) Bex: and it doesnt have a funny dinosaur icon
</pre>
