What with me doing the whole leave-Rhodes thing at the end of this year (I swear I'm going to! Why does nobody believe me?), I need to start thinking about getting a job and supporting myself and becoming a productive member of society and paying tax and fitting in and wearing a tie and growing old and being boring and eventually dying without ever having properly learned a musical instrument.  Or something.
</p>
<p>
The point is, I need to apply for jobs.
</p>
<p>
So, I need a CV.  I had <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/cvold">one</a>, but it kinda sucked. I mean, it was apparently quite impressive to the first years who read it on my site (it's that winning a six-pack of beer from the Philosophy department, isn't it?), but it's not going to score me a job. So, I needed to rewrite it.
</p>
<p>
With Ivan (a.k.a. Oryx) Groenewald's help, bless his cotton M. C. Hammer pants, I reworked it, and chopped out the bits about winning the egg and spoon race in Grade 3, and moved the boring bits that nobody wants to read to the end, and added the bits that are actually going to get me jobs, and I came up with <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/cv">this</a>.
</p>
<p>
I then sent it off to one or two people, and I await results. When I get time (in between going out, watching Scrubs, reading arb crap, IRCing, and basically messing around and being a tosser, I don't have much time) I will go through the list of companies that <a href="http://radbrad.rucus.net/">Darb</a> has mentioned to me, and spam them all with the story of my life, and why they should hire me.
</p>
<p>
I have already had a reply back from <a href="http://www.frogfoot.net/">Abraham at Frogfoot</a>.  And I've only really sent it to him, Obsidian, and some guy in Cape Town who wanted a perl developer.  Abraham's reply, in gist, was that he had a position for me, but I was overqualified for it, and I could do better.  However, Frogfoot seems like exactly the sort of place I want to work at. It's small and growing, and it's run by IRC geeks, for crying out loud. They're both Debian developers! They don't even like Microsoft mice in there!</p>
<p>
Is it bad that I value the open-source-ity of a job more than the salary, the position, and even the location?
</p>
<p>
I also spoke to Siv (I'd like to put a hyperlink to Siv in at this point, but where would I link to? And who doesn't know Siv? I mean... It's Siv!) about next year. He was the one who suggested I mail Obsidian (although Darb and <a href="http://mithrandr.moria.org/">Neil</a> had both already mentioned it). And he spoke to some dude there, and gave me a pretty glowing reference. Or gave him the reference, to me. Erm, you know what I mean. He told the dude that I rocked. Which I thought was nice of him.  He left out the bit about how I'd wasted three years of my life simply not doing anything for my Masters, and how I wasn't able to stick to any one topic, nor was I able to follow through on any of my ideas. Which I thought was good of him. I have, of course, undone all his good work by blabbing about it on my blog, but I'm cute that way.
</p>
<p>
The other option that I have right now is, of course, <a href="http://www.serendipity.org.za/">Jaco</a> at <a href="http://www.is.co.za/">Internet Solutions</a>. He always said he'd get me a job if I wanted one. I'd be a bit scrowl to ask him for one, but it's an option, nevertheless.
</p>
<p>
Oh, yes, and Ivan says he could tell me exactly where to go in Stellenbosch to get a job, and I'd be there like the proverbial bear.
</p>
<p>
So, from my not-so-certain viewpoint, it seems I'm pretty much assured of a job next year? And now I need to start actually thinking about where I want to go, and what I want to do.
It's nice having a future.
