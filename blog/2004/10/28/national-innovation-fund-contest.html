Jason Penton entered the iLanga system on which we've been working to the National Innovation Fund Contest.  Basically, it seems that if you come up with a good idea for making money in a clever and innovative way, and you tell them about it, and yours is the best, they give you money. It's supposed to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit, or something.

The prize-giving was at a lunch this afternoon, up at the Gavin Relly (I always thought it was spelled "Reilly", but both the invitation, and the sign outside, said "Relly") Postgrad village.  The winners were announced at the lunch. I don't know how many applicants there were, but the first prize was R50,000 (that's fifty thousand Rand, ladies and gentlemen, fifty grand!), the second prize was R30k, and the third prize was R20k.

Well, to cut a long story short, we won. We came first. I am rather pleased about this, as you can imagine. I don't really have anything else to say at this point.
