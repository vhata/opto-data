<p>
This posting is a community experiment that tests how a meme, represented by this blog posting, spreads across blogspace, physical space and time. It will help to show how ideas travel across blogs in space and time and how blogs are connected. It may also help to show which blogs (and aggregation sites) are most influential in the propagation of memes. The dataset from this experiment will be public, and can be located via <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> (or <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>) by doing a search for the GUID for this meme (below).

The original posting for this experiment is located at: <a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2004/08/a_sonar_ping_of.html">Minding the Planet</a> (Permalink: <a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2004/08/a_sonar_ping_of.html">http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2004/08/a_sonar_ping_of.html</a>) --- results and commentary will appear there in the future. 
</p>
<p>
Please join the test by adding your blog (see instructions, below) and inviting your friends to participate -- the more the better. The data from this test will be public and open; others may use it to visualize and study the connectedness of blogspace and the propagation of memes across blogs.</p>
<p>
The GUID for this experiment is: as098398298250swg9e98929872525389t9987898tq98wteqtgaq62010920352598gawst
(this GUID enables anyone to easily search Google or other search engines for all blogs that participate in this experiment, once they have indexed the sites that participate). Anyone is free to analyze the data of this experiment. Please publicize your analysis of the data, and/or any comments by adding comments onto the original post (see URL above). (Note: it would be interesting to see a geographic map or a temporal animation, as well as a social network map of the propagation of this meme.)
