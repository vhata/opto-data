As <a href="http://zion.ru.ac.za/cgi-bin/blosxom/2004/11/01#jabber_bird">Pierre describes</a>, a bird got trapped in his boss Toni's office, and tried to contact us on Jabber for help.  I obviously give off less of an air of Samaritanity, since I only got the one message:

<blockquote>

<i>For those who don't get the title of this post, the Jubjub bird is mentioned as something of which to beware in Lewis Carroll's poem <a href="http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/jabber/jabberwocky.html">the Jabberwocky</a>. Geddit? Jabber... Wocky?  Jabber?  Geddit?</i>
