Well, I now have a working version of my system.  Here is what it does:
</p>
<p>
You dial a certain extension on the PBX, and get music being played through the phone.  Pressing '5' on the phone keypad will pause/unpause the music, '3' will go on to the next song, and so on.
</p>
<p>
You can go to a certain page in your webbrowser, and you are presented with what is effectively an HTML view of a music player - links to "pause", "play", "next", etc.  Following these links simply returns you to the same page, but also has the desired effect on the music coming out of your phone. In other words, you can control the music coming out of your phone from a web-page.
</p>
<p>
Further, you can load up a little GTK application on your local machine, which looks (okay, it <b>could</b> look, if I put the effort in to make it pretty) like any old mp3 player, with pause/play buttons, etc.  However, this app also controls the music coming out of your phone.
</p>
<p>
Basically, what was originally a "phone service" has been turned into a general service that can be controlled from any medium - it would be absolutely trivial to write an IRC bot that accepted "pause", "play", "next" commands and passed them on.
</p>
<p>
This is good, because it means I can write a thesis on the convergence of plain-old-telephone-systems and "next-generation" networks controlled by web-browsers and desktop applications and so on.
</p>
<p>
Wheee.
