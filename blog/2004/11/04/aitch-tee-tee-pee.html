<a href="http://bug.reaper.org/">Bug</a> and <a href="http://radbrad.rucus.net/">Darb</a> have both <a href="http://bug.reaper.org/archives/000050.html">blogged</a> about <a href="http://radbrad.rucus.net/news/show_item.php?id=90">http</a> and what <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google's</a> first match for an <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=http">http search</a> is. They (rightly) do not think it's a good thing that Microsoft has managed to get the top match. After all that that corporation has done to destroy various standards, they definitely don't deserve the match for that one. However, I can't say I agree with Bug's choice of Google itself as the right benefactor of the search. My other option would be <a href="http://www.w3.org/">the W3C</a>, but if you're going to start a googlebomb to give them "http", then you should damn well make sure that they get "html" and "xml" as well, which they don't.

I'm not sure I really agree with all this googlebombing anyway. Dom has his <a href="http://singe.rucus.net/blog/archives/225-Spread-Firefox.html">link to Microsoft's browser</a> that he uses all the time, and there was the famous <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=litigious+bastards">litigious bastards</a> Googlebomb that worked so well.  But that was for fun. You shouldn't interfere with nature. Let Google work in its mysterious ways, its wonders to perform.

<p>
To summarise: we're all way too bored and worry to much about arb crap.
