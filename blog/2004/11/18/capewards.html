I heard from the chap about the interview.  He's been looking for flights, and has found one for me 
next weekend:
</p>
<blockquote>
PE-CTN 26th November. Depart 15:45 and arrive 16:55<br />
CTN-PE 28th November. Depart 10:20 and arrive 11:30<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
Is it bad that I don't want to go that weekend because Tim and Bronwyn are leaving on the 28th? I don't think I can be picky, though, for goodness sakes. I'll say goodbye to them before I leave.  Noodle is leaving on the 29th, and I shall be distraught if I don't see her before she goes, but that should be fine.
</p>

So, anyway, that's it. I'm going for an interview.  Apparently I can't wear my jean-pant, so I need to go and purchase an Executive Pant, and maybe a shirt with Real Buttons, and stuff like that. Hectic. Getting a job means being a Real Person. Who knew?

Next step: try to convince <a href="http://www.xanga.com/carxmoss">Claire</a> to come pick me up from the airport on the 26th.
