So I had the telephone interview.  It was really cool, actually. I prepared for it by having some coffee and listening to lots and lots of <a href="http://www.fatboyslim.net/">Fatboy Slim</a> for the required mojo.  Track 1 of the new album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002Y4T8I?v=glance">Palookaville</a> is called "Don't Let The Man", and it has a sample from the <a href="http://www.fivemanelectricalband.ca/">Five Man Electrical Band</a> that goes:
<blockquote>
And the sign said "Long-haired freaky people need not apply".
</blockquote>
Which I figured was excellent motivation for my first job interview.
</p>
<p>
The interview itself went well.  The guy seems to be a bona fide Nice Guy (tm).  He used a Metaphor, and I like metaphors.  And he said that one thing that stood out about my CV was that I'd done Philosophy, which made me want to give him a big hug.  Because, like, Philosophy, it's my thing, you know, really.
</p>
<p>
He said, I think, that I could choose what I wanted to do.  He wants me to do software development, he thinks I'd do best at that, but if I really want to do system administration, then it can fit.
</p>
<p>
Another bonus is that if I need time to finish my thesis (hah! No, but seriously), then that could fit, as well.
</p>
<p>
He asked me the nasty question. The one about "How much do you want to earn?".  I figured "One million dollars" was not a good answer, so I told him what I actually thought. Namely, that I like to have enough money to pay my rent and eat food, and have a bit left over for a beer afterwards, you know? But apart from that, I really want to get out there, get some experience and stuff. So, we will discuss salaries later, it seems.
</p>
<p>
And then we made a plan to meet. We decided on the 17th of December, 9am, and I'd go to Stellenbosch, but if I couldn't get transport, they'd drive up to Cape Town to see me. And that was pretty much the end of the interview.

See, it's a good thing I didn't blog this straight away.  Because, they phoned me back just now.  They want to see me sooner than the 17th of December. They want to see me next weekend, or the weekend afterwards. And, they are going to fly me down to Cape Town in order to see them. Which, frankly, blows me away. So, ja. I'm going to Cape Town.
