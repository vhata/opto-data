Tamara and I went and booked our plane tickets the day before yesterday.  <a href="http://www.kulula.com/">Kulula</a> has some amazingly cheap offers.  I would never have even thought of flying, but the supremely organised Tamara compared the prices of every form of transport there is, and concluded that it would be better all round if we flew.

I have a meeting with Abraham at <a href="http://www.frogfoot.net/">Frogfoot</a> on the 15th of December, so I'm flying down on the 14th. I've booked a ticket back on the 5th of January, which fits in nicely with the little illusion I've been maintaining that I'm going to be handing a thesis in on the 15th of January.
