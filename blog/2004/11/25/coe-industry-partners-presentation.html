Today was the "Center of Excellence Industry Partners Visit".  This means that all the people who donate masses of money to our Center of Excellence in the vague hope that we'll research something of use to them come to visit, and we try to convince them we've been doing something useful, and then we use their money to host a big lunch for them.

I gave a presentation on what I've done so far, and you can <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/masters/coe/">view it online</a>.

I thought it went well.  I handled their questions.  I managed to avoid my usual "I'm a little teapot" pose that happened whenever I was holding forth at SATNAC.  I used the word "um" only every four words, instead of every two words - a good step up!

Giving this presentation made me realise that most of my work has been about authentication. Which was insightful - it is all about authentication, really.  You need authentication to create a valid pathway between the two end entities.  Once that has been created, it's all just sending commands back and forth, and streaming stuff between them.
