Well, I've booked another driving test.  On the 25th of January, nogal.  I don't know why Nigerian 419ers bother with all that email stuff, when they could just charge people money for failing tests.</p>

Also, I tried to collect Noodle's license for her, but they still don't have it.  Bureaucracy se ma.
