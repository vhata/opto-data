As covered <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/blog/archives/37-BI-529-Saffie.html">a month ago</a> and <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/blog/archives/25-To-be-a-Saffie.html">two months ago</a>, I am trying to get South African citizenship.  I just went back ("6 to 8 weeks"), and they still had no reply from Pretoria.  They're going to phone 'em, and then they're going to phone me.  I wait with bated breath.
