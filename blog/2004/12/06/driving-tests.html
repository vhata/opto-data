So, I went for my driving test today.
</p>
<p>
It probably wasn't helpful that we had a braii at Mordor last night (<a href="http://russell.rucus.net/">Russell's</a> new digs), and then went out until late.  I ended up staying up until stupid o'clock with my new hippie digsmates, and even though they promised to make me coffee and breakfast this morning, they didn't.  However, I actually felt fine for the test, not tired in the slightest.  I had a lesson before the test, and drove around fine, no mistakes really (must remember to look in the blasted mirror before putting the brakes on, and to take corners in second gear), and then went to the yard and did some docking and parking and suchlike.  Easy stuff.  The examiner watched me doing them all, too.
</p>
<p>
Then the test itself started, I did everything just fine, pre-test inspection, hill start, docking, three-point turn, and so on.  And just as I was doing the final bit, the last piece of parrallel parking, I bumped into the pavement, because I was going too fast, because my leg was shaking and I had the clutch in too far.
</p>
<p>
So, that's that.  Fail.  I didn't even get to go on the road.  Insane.  It's just so frustrating - he KNOWS I can do the parrallel parking, he KNOWS I can drive, because he's seen me do it fine. But The Rules State That You Fail If You Do Certain Things.  No second chance, nothing.  And there's no free spots for a second test until January the 24th or something.  That really burns my bum.

Still, as Ivan says, anybody who has watched the Matrix knows that you never make the first jump.
