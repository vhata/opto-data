I leave tomorrow for Cape Town again. I am taking with me what I'll need to work while I'm there:
<ul>
<li>My writeup so far</li>
<li>My sourcecode</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix</a> CD in case I can't find any Linux machines</li>
<li>Four Fatboy Slim albums</li>
</ul>
That should keep me going.  Daniel Schroder has offered me a login to the Astronomy lab at UCT (at the top of the Maths department), which has ssh, lyx, bandwidth, etc, everything I'll need to be productive.  The only trouble is I can't wander in there at any hour of the day.  Alf has tried/is trying to get hold of a laptop for me, but without much luck, thanks to Yogan.  That punk.

I'm looking forward to going to Cape Town - there's nobody really left in Grahamstown, even my hippies have disappeared in a cloud of smoke (literally). I'm going to go visit Frogfoot, and pop down to Stellenbosch to put my 'X' on Adept's piece of paper, and so on.

Anyway, there won't be much activity on this blog till I get back.  Doncha know.
