I completed the basic structure for my final thesis write-up a few days ago, and have now begun gradually fleshing it out, filling in the chapters, and suchlike.
</p>
<p>
I'm actually really pleased with the whole thing.  Several of the chapters are actually things I'm really looking forward to writing about, and will enjoy it.  The only one I'm a bit trepidatious (awesome word) about is Chapter 2 - "Related Work".  Literature Surveys are for pansies and foreigners. Or something.  It won't actually be that difficult - I already have several things in mind to write about.  But it won't be fun.

<p>
So, in summary, the thesis is actually going pretty well. In spite of everything that everybody (me especially) has said.
</p>

I also got an official job offer for next year.  A slight hiccup might arise from the fact that thesis progress aside, politics and red tape and suchlike might mean that I can only finish the thesis a week or two into February, and so won't be able to start work in the beginning of February. We shall see how that turns out, though.
