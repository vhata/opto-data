Well, Cape Town has been fairly uneventful really.  Apart from reading five books, drinking some wine, and going out to play pool once, I've done nothing but spend masses of money SMSing hippies and TDMFs. Oh, and I watched the Animatrix.

I went to try to find Daniel Schroeder, and g'damn but the Maths Department is a maze.  I swear it was designed by M.C.Escher himself. Like, you walk around for half an hour, and suddenly realise you're on a different floor, even though you've been up the same number of staircases you went down.  And the exit is, of course, on the second floor, not the first floor. I did find Daniel's office, but he wasn't there.  I went back once or twice, to see if he'd returned - a complicated process of going all the way along the one corridor, out, round, up, down, back up, through, behind, round, and along - but he hadn't.  It was only on the last time that I went to his door that I realised that there was a hidden staircase that led straight there.  I swear if I'd turned and tried walking along the wall I would have found a whole extra set of rooms, or something.

I did pop into the Compsci Department and found Matthew West (aka Lonewolf).

Oooh, I lied - I have done one thing of note in Cape Town. I went to visit Frogfoot, and met Abraham and Johann. It's actually an awesome place - I think I'd enjoy working there.  They do lots of embedded stuff, and are almost as rabid and fundamentalist about what platform they use to do things as I am. Unfortunately, as soon as I set foot on the premises, the power died, so when they took me on tour to show me the data center and the satellite dishes and whatnot, we had to grope around in the dark a lot.  It came back eventually, and we finished the tour.

I'm currently sitting in an office in the Red Cross Children's Hospital - my uncle's office, to be precise. Being in a hospital is weird. I think I've watched too much Scrubs. I searched for a janitor everywhere, but to no avail. I'm supposed to be doing more writeup but, as usual, it's going fairly slowly. At least I've managed to get hold of the articles and papers that I did before, that I need.

I don't know when I'll next have connectivity - various people have offered, but Cape Town is big, and I am small, and I do not have my own transport.
