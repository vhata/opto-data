I got my confirmation-of-receipt from the SATNAC dude, today.  In effect this means:</p>
<ol>
<li>email is a viable method of communication</li>
<li>I can read basic instructions on a website that tell me how to submit a paper</li>
</ol>
<p>No more, no less.</p>
<p>Now we wait to see whether it was actually accepted</p>
