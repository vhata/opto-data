<a href="http://www.nafest.co.za/">
Festival</a> week is now over, and I am absolutely exhausted. Everybody who was here has left now - <a href="http://www.serendipity.org.za/bje/">Jaco</a> and <a href="http://www.xanga.com/adstix">Adeline</a> and <a href="http://www.xanga.com/carxmoss">Claire</a>, Bridget and Claire, Ross and Claire, the Squash people (one of whom was probably called Claire), etc. I still haven't finished my paper, but I'm getting closer and closer to it. Maybe I'll be able to get some sleep soon?<br /><br /><br />
    
Another festival has come and gone.  I didn't do much festival-wise - I basically went to things that other people invited me to.  Giselle, the ballet, with Ingrid, was good, although not as good as Swan Lake last year, I thought. I did see some truly excellent Jazz, Carlo Mombelli on the bass, Marcus Wyatt on the trumpet.  I also watched Prime Circle live, which was entertaining.  I almost watched the Springbok Nude Girls - arguably South Africa's best band, whom I've been keen to see ever since I stupidly didn't watch them in my first year - but at the last moment, Bridget told me that she was tired after the trip, and wouldn't be going out, so I sold my ticket to Claire-from-Capetown, and went to spend some time with Bridget.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.serendipity.org.za/bje/">Jaco</a> and <a href="http://www.xanga.com/adstix">Adeline</a> were down for the week.  It was great to meet Jaco after knowing of him, and then knowing him, online - he really is an awesome guy, and incredibly bright.  It's nice to have connections with various IT people around South Africa, but he's good to have as a friend too.  Adeline is a friend of his from Cape Town, who occasionally appears on Lagnet, and she came down with him.  It was fantastic to meet her, too: she's incredibly fun, and bright, and all-round good company.  Claire is her over-exuberant friend, also from Cape Town, and, while a little scary, also fun.<br /><br />Bridget left early this morning, having gone to bed at about half-past six yesterday evening. I was a little surprised, and rather disappointed, that she should just disappear so early - she phoned me to say &quot;tired, sick, going to bed, see you next term&quot;.  She wouldn't even let me go round to say goodbye.  Puellae hostes sunt.  Ah, well, I know what she's like when she's sick/tired, I don't blame her for throwing in the towel early.<br /><br />My various digsmates are doing the shift-change, too - some leaving, some arriving back.  Jess's brother Ross, and his girlfriend (also Claire), have left, too.<br /><br />So, all is quietening down - schoolsfest is happening, but that's it.  Ingrid has gone to Pretoria, Dave has gone to Knysna, Tim has gone back to Ladybrand (via Zimbabwe?) - it's just cliff, Russell and I left.<br /><br />I am still tutoring the RUMEP people - it's exhausting, but quite rewarding when they understand something. It finishes on Thursday, praise the Lawd.  By then, I will have finished this gawdamn paper, too, and I can relax a little.<br /><br />
