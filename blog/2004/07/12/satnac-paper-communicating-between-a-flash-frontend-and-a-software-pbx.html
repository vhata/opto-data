I'm supposed to be writing up the work I did on Jason's software PBX, and it's going very very slowly.<br /><br />
 Apparently this paper is supposed to be a work-in-progress paper, which would mean that it is two pages long.Â  I'm on the sixth page, and nowhere near finished yet.Â  I had troubles with phrasing things at first - I couldn't get into the flow.Â  Now I'm in the flow, I don't know how much to write.Â  I could just keep writing for as long as you want, really - I could go in depth about Python/Twisted, and why event-based architectures are good for what I'm using them for, I could justify Perl and PHP for the uses I put them to, I could write thirty pages on this.<br /><br />How much am I supposed to write?<br /><br />Alfredo is getting antsy about this paper - he wants it in, understandably.Â  He has informed me that he is not going to give me my money until I hand it in.Â  Well, I want to hand it in as much as the next person.Â  I'm just so tired the whole time.Â  I'm exhausted now, I could really just collapse into bed.Â  What would make me feel even better is a nice cold beer and then a collapse-into-bed - the stress of tutoring RUMEP students who don't know how to use a mouse, combined with trying to remember everything else that has been going on is not doing me any good.<br /><br />I'm basically going to just write as much as I think is sufficient for all the headings I've got, and hand it to him.Â  If he wants me to flesh it out, or summarise it, then I will.Â  For now, let me just get it done.<br /><br />
