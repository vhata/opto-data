They Might Be Giants</a> are, and always have been, an awesome band.  They're something of a geek meme - nobody else has ever heard of them.  And they're clearly catching on to the new age of <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/drm/" title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</a>:<br /><a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/04/0249245">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/04/0249245</a><br /><br />Open Source is about choice, and Linux users are spoiled. I knew it anyway:<br /><a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/03/211212">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/03/211212</a><br /><br />Online <a href="http://userpages.umbc.edu/~mabzug1/cs/md5/md5.html">MD5</a> cracking service!?  So what does &quot;<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/03/1728231&mode=thread&tid=126&tid=172&tid=93">f3789b3c1be47758203f9e8a4d8c6a2a</a>&quot; mean?  I suppose this is no worse than being able to download john the ripper for free, but it's still a bit scary.<br /><a href="http://passcracking.com/">http://passcracking.com/</a><br /><br />Weird little online movies:<br /><a href="http://www.shannonplumb.com/">http://www.shannonplumb.com/</a><br /><br />A novel about how to kill the American President?  I'd love to see how people react to this.<br /><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/07/03/new_fiction_novel_fe.html">http://www.boingboing.net/2004/07/03/new_fiction_novel_fe.html</a><br />While on the subject, somebody should take out the VP, too - how can anybody take him seriously?<br /><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/06/25/mr_vice_president_ha.html">http://www.boingboing.net/2004/06/25/mr_vice_president_ha.html</a><br /><br />SkyOS? Never heard of it. Who wants to try it?  I actually think I might install this on rei.  Just for kicks.  Like I don't have plenty to do anyway.<br /><a href="http://www2.skyos.org/aboutnew.php">http://www2.skyos.org/aboutnew.php</a><br /><br />&quot;Quiet Diplomacy in Zimbabwe has failed, but we're going to carry on with it anyway.&quot; I was actually discussing this with <span style="font-style: italic;">Ross</span> two nights ago - Mbeki doesn't really have a choice in this matter.  Mugabe was the original Nelson Mandela of Africa, he was pretty much the first person to stand up against Britain and tell them where to shove their colonialism.  People look up to him, even though everybody probably realises that he's fucked it up a bit now.  If Mbeki went up against him, as people seem to want him to, Mbeki would lose face, not Mugabe.  The onyl real &quot;solution&quot; is for Mugabe just to die, and be replaced by something better.<br /><a href="http://www.newsisfree.com/iclick/i,43092179,7221,f/">http://www.newsisfree.com/iclick/i,43092179,7221,f/</a><br /><br /><br />
