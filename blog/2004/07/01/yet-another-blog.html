So, I've started Yet Another Blog.Â  This time, however, I'm not going to feel under any pressure to update it.Â  I'll add entries when I have something to say, or something that I want to show others, but that's it.
 My other blogs all kind of fell into disrepair because I felt that I had to keep updating them (largely prompted by the needlings of <a href="http://lair.moria.org/">Barry Irwin</a>, of course), so I kept putting up posts of <a href="http://www.wibsite.com/wiblog/dull/" title="The Dullest Blog In The World">crap</a> (&quot;I did a lot of nothing this weekend&quot;), and eventually decided that it just wasn't worth it.<br /><br />I do have stuff to say, however - the other night I thought I might like to discuss <a href="http://www.mithrandi.za.net/blog/">Tristan</a>'s audio player, <a href="http://svn.slipgate.za.net/pyfersucht/">pyfersucht</a>, in a blog entry.Â  If I don't say anything, however, it'll be because I either don't want to, or just didn't.Â  And that's that.
