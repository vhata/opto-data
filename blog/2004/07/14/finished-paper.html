Well, I finished my paper.<br /><br />And Alf liked it so much that now he wants me to change my thesis topic?!<br /><br /><br />
 My paper was about a user interface I wrote for Jason's software PBX.Â  I used <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/">Flash</a> as the main frontend, but it needed a number of ways to communicate with the actual PBX - it needed to do database lookups, and all sorts of things.Â  Since Flash is not that powerful a language, I used what it had, and plugged it into my own scripts, written in more powerful languages - <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>, <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>, and so on.<br /><br />Apparently, when I write about my open source languages, and their benefits, and why I chose them, and the scripts I wrote in them, my writing is &quot;much more mature&quot; and &quot;focussed&quot;. Possibly because I actually give a damn about it.Â  Anyway, because of this, Alfredo wants me to do my thesis on something like &quot;wrapping a core system in user-friendly interfaces using open source tools&quot;, or some similar topic.Â  Frankly, it doesn't sound much like a Masters thesis to me, but we'll have to see.<br /><br />Anyway, the paper is completed.Â  It was way too long, and now I have to slim it down substantially before I submit it, but the main slog is over.<br /><br />
