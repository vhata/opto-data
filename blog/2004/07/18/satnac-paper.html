Since my paper was eight pages long, and I'm submitting it as a Work In Progress (even though it's basically finished), and WIP papers are only supposed to be two pages long, I've had to more or less rewrite it.Â  I've finally finished it, and sent it off to Alf for a read, we'll see what he says.<br /><br />
