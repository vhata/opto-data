I'm going to California in two days time, for a week.  My bosses and I are going to <a href="http://www.ispcon.com/fall2005/">the ISP Convention</a>.
</p>
<p>
I will attempt to blog about it all I can.  I have a whole <b>stack</b> of song titles to use as blog-entry titles.
</p>
<p>
The song in the title is the theme tune of the show <a href="http://www.fox.com/oc/">the OC</a>. The show makes California look idyllic, and the lyrics of the song are:
<blockquote>
We've been on the run<br />
Driving in the sun<br />
Looking out for #1<br />
California here we come<br />
Right back where we started from<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
California!<br />
Here we come!<br />
<br />
On the stereo<br />
Listen as we go<br />
Nothing's gonna stop me now<br />
California here we come<br />
Right back where we started from<br />
Pedal to the floor<br />
Thinkin' of the roar<br />
Gotta get us to the show<br />
California here we come<br />
Right back where we started from<br />
<br />
California!<br />
Here we come<br />
</blockquote>
California seems to be pretty much a dream destination.  However, the funny bit is, I'm not especially excited.  I'm keen to go and all, although I'm more looking forward to seeing <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/photos/tim">Tim</a> and the Family Girls, to be frank.

Getting an American Visa was actually quite easy - we filled in the forms, and went down to the American Embassy in Cape Town early on Tuesday morning. We had to go through metal detectors to get into the building, and then up to the seventh floor where the embassy was.  They wouldn't let us in, however, we had to queue down the stairs while they took people in one at a time.  These people were then searched and metal-detectored before being allowed in properly.
</p>
<p>
Now, I take my satchel with me everywhere, and it's got all sorts of things in it, that I might need.  For example, it's got a toothbrush and toothpaste, a hat, a book, some strepsils, some deodorant, a can of liqui fruit, some oatbran, and so on.  It's just stuff I have in my bag, I don't think about it.  However, when we got to the embassy, they made me unpack the whole thing.  I also have a pocket of the bag where I chuck the after-dinner mints I get when I go out to eat. So, there are about 70 after-dinner mints in there now.  They unpacked every single one of them and scanned them all. Meanwhile, the queue behind me is huffing and puffing and I'm highly embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
They wouldn't let me take the liqui-fruit into the embassy (you know how dangerous fruit juice is), and they made me <b>eat</b> some of my toothpaste, in front of them, to prove that it wasn't anthrax, or something.  I had to spray some of my deodorant on my arm, to show it wasn't Saren Gas, or something.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I got the Visa, and I'm going to America.  The Visa doesn't guarantee entry to the country, of course. It just means they won't <b>definitely</b> refuse you access.  They can still turn you away when you get to the port of entry.
