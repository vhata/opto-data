<a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/photos/carxmoss">Claire</a> picked me up from work on Friday afternoon, took me home, gave me a beer, and packed my bag for me.  Then she took me to Cape Town, dropped me off at the Morreira's house for supper, and I met up with her and Adeline at Stones later, and we went to Cornerhouse till 4am. On Saturday morning, Adeline picked me up from the Morreira's, and took me to the airport, where I met up with my boss, <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/photos/jac">Jac</a>, and we flew to Joburg. <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/photos/tim">Tim</a> picked me up from the airport, and we went to his flat, where we had a braai and made cocktails with the Family Girls (represented by Megan, Noodle, Jess, Bronwyn, Laura, Toni). The cocktails were strawberry daiquiris, frozen margaritas, and mojitos, and were a great success.  We then went to Tiger Tiger until 4 in the morning, which was awesome. Tim dropped me off at the airport the next day, and we went to America.

The flight was long. They only gave us three whiskeys and a carafe of wine.  I watched three movies and slept a bit. We landed in Washington at about noon, but it was only 6am there.  What's that all about?  Can't Americans tell the time? I had a bagel and cream-cheese for breakfast, as seen on <a href="http://www.fox.com/oc/">the OC</a>. We then went to the Smithsonian Space and Flight Museum, which was excellent. We watched two iMax movies, and saw all the planes and whatnot.  I saw <a href="http://www.theenolagay.com/">the Enola Gay</a>!

Finally, we got on the plane to St Louis (pronounced Lewis, not Looie, apparently?). It's very green and swampy. There, we caught a connecting flight to Santa Clara, California, where we arrived at about 9pm. We were picked up at the airport by the owner (manager?) of the hotel we were going to be staying at. He was a really lovely guy, an indian called Jay Shah, but known to us as "An' All" (or "En Alles"), due to his constant use of the phrase. The hotel was quite nice, too, although we never really made full use of the facilities it offered.
