I bought a camera and an iPod Nano while in California, and I'm really pleased I did.

The Nano is the sweetest little device - mine's a sexy black thing, so small you could probably swallow it.  It holds 4 gigabytes of music, and has really good quality sound. I also bought a sort of arm-band thing that you can put the Nano in, for when you go running, for example - I've tested it once, and it works awesomely.

My camera is a <a href="http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital/Powershot_A620/">Canon Powershot A620</a>, and I'm really pleased with it, too.  I've started <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vhata/">experimenting</a> with it, and I'm quite pleased.  I still haven't worked out where I'm going to put all my photos and how I'm going to organise them and stuff.  We'll see.
