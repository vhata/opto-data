Apologies for a seriously late post. Joburg was great, we didn't win, we didn't expect to, much fun was had by all.

LinuxWorld was great fun. I got to work at the Go:Opensource stand, doing my bit for Linux Advocacy, and earning myself a free geek t-shirt and a geek mug, and stuff. I also met Jon "Maddog" Hall, who was quite a character, as one would expect. One thing that did surprise me was the puppy-dog awe with which several of the other geeks (Rhodes ones specifically) treated him.  I wouldn't say that I am a disrespectful person. I just give everybody the same amount of respect (where "everybody", of course, means "everybody, except children and women and foreigners and poor people and cripples and stupid people and the insane and black people and Jews and lawyers and gay people and criminals and people who like Westlife and the Dutch").  Maybe there's not enough to go round or something. I just didn't feel that anybody, no matter how famous, should be treated with such awe and trembling. He's just this guy, you know? A really nice guy, with some great stories, and a lot of experience and wisdom under his belt. But just a guy.

One upshot of going to Joburg is that I have been offered a job at OpenVoice. Which makes my life substantially more complicated.
