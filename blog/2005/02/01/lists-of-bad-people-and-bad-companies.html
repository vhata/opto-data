<a href="http://singe.rucus.net/blog/">Dominic</a> has a <a href="http://singe.rucus.net/blog/archives/332-Worst-Corporations-for-2004.html">post</a> about the <a href="http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=11808">Ten Worst Corporations of 2004</a>. A lot of people, I will accept, are stupid and lazy and uninformed, and thus do not know about these corporations. But those of you who claim not to be stupid and lazy and uninformed, and yet still continue to support these corporations ("I like the taste", for heaven's sake, is as good an excuse as saying "I like the colour of oilspills")... How can you live with yourselves?

Secondly, there is an incredibly amusing article over at <a href="http://www.buffalobeast.com/">the Beast</a> about <a href="http://www.buffalobeast.com/66/50mostLoathsome2004.htm">the Fifty Most Loathsome People of 2004</a>. You should go and read it, by the way - you are placed at the third most loathsome.
