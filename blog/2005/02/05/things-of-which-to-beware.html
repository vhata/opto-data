<h2>Be cautious!  Be alert!</h2>
<h5>(The world needs more lerts)<sup>[1]</sup></h5>
<p>
We have seen an increase in the number of roving gangs of teenage girls who deliver gifts of cookies to people's houses. This menace can not be stressed too forcefully. Thankfully, <a href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/nationworld/articles/1229527.html">these two</a> insipid little blighters got their just desserts <sup>[2]</sup>.  Spurning the opportunity to attend a dance, they chose to spend their night baking cookies for unsuspecting neighbours. Thankfully, one of the neighbours managed to successfully sue them for $900 in medical fees after they frightened her by banging on her door to give her the cookies.

Secondly, we have uncovered <a href="http://www.bitfurnace.com/TheCuddlyMenace/">evidence of an alien invasion</a>.  Maintain constant vigilance.

Thirdly, the problem of <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/rpriebe/cs_ed_sp02/links/prep.htm">dangling prepositions</a> is growing, too.  See how the title of this blog entry is NOT "Things to beware of"? This is because a preposition at the end of a sentence is something up with which I will not put.

<b>Update [1]</b> Be aloof. We have enough lerts now.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update [2]</b> I mis-spelled this - it's <a href="http://www.snopes.com/language/notthink/deserts.htm">"just deserts"</a>, from the same root as "deserve". However, in this context, I think "desserts" works rather well.

<b>Update: </b> It seems <a href="http://dbhome.dk/carlo/cat.htm">cats are evil</a>, too.
