How could I not write about Hunter S. Thompson committing suicide?  (Although, of course it wasn't suicide - Courtney Love killed him.)
</p>
<p>
There he goes. One of God's own prototypes. Some kind of high powered mutant never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die. You should have taken care of him, Lord. But you didn't, and now you're gonna have him on your hands.

Fact is, he had to get out of here. I think he was getting the Fear. His trip was different. It was a classic affirmation of everything right and true in the national character. A gross physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country. But only for those with true grit. And he was chock full of that, man.

<p>
Jesus, bad waves of paranoia, madness, fear and loathing - intolerable vibrations in this place. Get out. The weasels were closing in. I could smell the ugly brutes. Flee. You can't stop here!  This is bat country!
</p>
<p>
Well, apart from that, all I'm going to say is that <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/index.php?p=375">this</a> is a pretty good cover of it.

<b>Update:</b>
USA Today printed a correction to one of its articles:
<blockquote>
A story Feb. 21 wrongly attributed a quote to Richard Nixon as saying Hunter S. Thompson was "that dark, venal, and incurably violent side of the American character." It was Thompson who made that remark about Nixon.

Brilliant. [<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/mholmesiv/47380.html">via</a>]
