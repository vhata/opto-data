I went through to Cape Town on Thursday, for the <a href="http://www.frogfoot.net/beach-party-2005/">Frogfoot beach party</a> which was good fun.  <a href="http://www.xanga.com/carxmoss">Claire</a> crashed the party to see me, which was cool.  Then on Friday, she came down for a quick visit, to see my work and my house and stuff.  Unfortunately, her car broke down, and we ended up waiting till 11:30 for her parents to come pick her up.  I was exhausted after Thursday night, but it was nice to see her, anyway.

On Saturday, Tristan Waterkeyn came through to get my help on his <a href="http://www.overtone.co.za/">Flash website</a>. This was good, because after that, we went out to see what Stellenbosch nightlife was like.  It was brilliant.  All I needed was somebody to go with. We went to <i>Bohemia</i>, then the <i>Mystic Boere</i> (I swear, that's what it's called), then <i>Fandango</i>, then <i>Terrace</i>, then <i>Rugby</i>, then <i>the Belgian Beer Pub</i>, then <i>Stones</i>, then <i>Sunrise</i>, then Steers.  It was great.  I like it here.

Adeline came through on Sunday, in between her shifts at work.  She could only stay about half an hour, but she brought me breakfast for Monday (a muffin, some yoghurt, and some orange juice), because she's fantastic.</p>

Then I did laundry at the <a href="http://vhata.net/blog/2005/02/28/the-neelsie">Neelsie</a>.
