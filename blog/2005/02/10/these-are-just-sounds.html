More addictive than crack cocaine, more uplifting than crystal meth, more repetitive than a man on marijuana, weirder than an acid trip.

I don't know what it is about memes.  Why do geeks love them?  Anyway, I've just discovered a meme that we at Rhodes came a little late to. Apparently there's a song called <i>"Dragostea Din Tei"</i> by a band called <i>O-Zone</i> (although it's also done by <i>Haiiduci</i>?). The lyrics are <a href="http://www.catteacorner.com/dragosteadintei.htm">here</a>, in Romanian, with English translations.  Note with joy the translation of the chorus.

The thing is.  The <b>thing</b> is. Some lad out there, vaguely reminiscent of Ghyslain<sup>[1]</sup>, recorded himself singing along to the song. You can have a looksee <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/206373">here</a>, and I've got a copy up <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/stuff/numaye">here</a>. <a href="http://russell.rucus.net/">Russell</a> and I have not been able to stop listening to/watching the damn thing.

<b>[1]</b> Ghyslain is a 15 year old boy from Quebec who became famous as the Starwars Kid after a video he made in his school basement. You can have a look at the video, and at the <b>fifteen</b> remixes that meme-obsessed geeks around the world made, <a href="http://www.jedimaster.net/">here</a>. The person originally responsible for the propagation of the meme is <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2003/04/29/star_war.shtml">here</a>. Ghyslain is identified <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2003/05/13/finding_.shtml">here</a>. He appears in Tony Hawk 3 <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2004/10/11/star_war.shtml">here</a>. Thousands of people petition to have him appear in Star Wars 3 <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/Ghyslain/petition.html">here</a>. And everybody apologises and raises over US$3000 to buy an iPod for Ghyslain <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2003/07/16/shipping.shtml">here</a>.
