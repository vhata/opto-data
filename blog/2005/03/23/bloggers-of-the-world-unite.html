There has recently been a spate of comment/trackback spam on a lot of blogs - this is one of the main reasons why I <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/blog/archives/85-Blog-Upgrade.html">upgraded</a> serendipity not so long ago. The point of comment/trackback spam is that it adds a link on your page to somewhere else, via certain keywords. One of the most prolific spammers has consistently linked the words <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_poker">online poker</a> to one of their own sites.  What this means is that when you <a href="http://www.google.co.za/search?q=online%20poker">search google</a> for those words, their site comes up first.

In what has been called vigilante justice by some, and democracy in action by others, the blogosphere have decided that enough is enough, and they are trying to googlebomb the words "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_poker">online poker</a>", to make them point to the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">wikipedia</a> entry of the same name.  The argument is that people who want to know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_poker">online poker</a> will find the wikipedia entry much more useful than some spammers site.  There are various arguments and counter-arguments (this will cause spammers to work even harder and cause even more damage; this is no better than the spammers themselves; etc). I am clearly in favour of the googlebomb. Maybe it's just peer pressure.  I do know that I was incredibly annoyed by all the comment/trackback spam I got.
