Yesterday I was invited to go and watch "Miss Matieland", the beauty pageant thing for Stellenbosch University.  You know the type of thing: all the girls parade around wearing stuff, they say "I wish for World Peace", and then one indistinguishable hot chick wins and nine other indistinguishable hot chicks don't.

Of course, I should make it clear that I absolutely disapprove of such events. They encourage the objectivization of women, and show disrespect to the female gender.  I was outraged that such an event should be happening in our town, and only went along so I could sit there with a disapproving frown and a sneer on my face all the way through.  I disapprove of treating objects like women.

On the upside, the whole place was absolutely swarming with <b>belters</b>, and the ten finalists were <b>HAWT</b> too. I thought the girl who came third (i.e. second princess) should definitely have won, if not the girl who was first princess, but the winner was quite a belter too.  It was fun.  They did feed us redbull-and-champagne beforehand, though, which is not something that a diabetic should really drink.  But banya, hey?
