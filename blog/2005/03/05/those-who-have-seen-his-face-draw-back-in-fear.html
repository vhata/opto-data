On Monday I went to watch the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293508/">movie</a> of the Phantom of the Opera.  I'm not sure what I was expecting.  I know that I really wanted to watch it when it was performed in Capetown and Joburg, but being stuck away in Grahamstown is not conducive to that sort of thing.  So this movie was the closest I could get to it.  And I must say I was really impressed.  The music, of course, is amazing - I have never watched it before in any form, and I really enjoyed watching out for the themes of the various characters (the most recognisable being the phantom's theme) as they get blended in with the other songs - for example, at the end of Masquerade when the phantom gatecrashes their little party. The characters, I thought, were particularly well cast - who knew that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000378/">Minnie Driver</a> would be a good Carlotta?  I was a bit surprised that they showed us what the Phantom's disfiguration was - does that normally happen?  I always thought it was left a bit of a mystery, since there isn't much that could really cause the amount of abuse he got?

Anyway, I recommend watching the movies, even if you are a die-hard fan of the performance. It was good.
