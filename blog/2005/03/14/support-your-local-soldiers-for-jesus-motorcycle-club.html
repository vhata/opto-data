I was sort of expecting to spend the weekend quietly working on my
thesis, or something similar.  As it turns out, that's not exactly what
happened.  I left home at 7:30am on Friday morning, and woke up in the
same clothes in Capetown on Sunday morning, very unsure of where I was.
</p>
<p>
What happened was, Tristan drove out to
Stellenbosch on Friday afternoon and picked me up from work, and took me
back to Capetown, and so the weekend began.
</p>
<p>
Pretty much as soon as we arrived in Capetown, we (Tristan and I and his
two digsmates, Rory and Rigard) went off to some party hosted by some
girl called Bianca (why are all the women in the Western Cape called
Bianca?!  What is it with being called Bianca!?  There were two Biancas
in Ms Matieland, and another three cropped up at various stages this
last weekend!).  The idea was that everybody brings a pizza
topping, and they make pizzas, and we eat them.  However, we didn't
really know any of the Biancas at the party, or anybody else, so we just
drank beer and ate all the pizza and acted like prats.
</p>
<p>
They kind of asked for it.  They all informed us that they didn't want
to be introduced to us because they'd forget our names, except for one
guy, who informed us that he wanted to know our names because he was
doing a memory course that meant he could remember everything, and he
wanted to try it out on us.  Which, of course, was just asking for it.
Thereafter, every hour, on the hour, we changed our names (I became
Kevin at 8pm, and Cedric at 9pm), and he lost track completely, and
wasn't sure whether his memory was going, or whether we were causing
trouble.  I think we may have set his memory course back weeks.
</p>
<p>
Then there was this stupid pretentious girl who wanted to disrupt
society with neon-coloured string.  I mean, come on.  She explained to
us that they were going to "six major cities" in the world, and trying
to break people out of their ruts and disrupt their conformist world-
views.  A very admirable fight-club style goal, although she seemed to
think she was being novel and revolutionary, but who hasn't watched a
movie about somebody who tries to make people think a bit differently?
Even American Beauty was about that.  And she honestly thought she was
being amazingly intelligent.  And here's the thing - she wanted to do it
with neon coloured string.  Her grand idea was to go and thread bits of
string everywhere, weaving a sort of neon-coloured web around people,
and this would make them think outside of the box.  She says she did it
in a restaurant, and "people really responded".  I mean, I would
respond.  My response would probably not be polite, though.
</p>
<p>
I asked her if the neon-coloured-ness of the string was important, and
whether people didn't respond as much to string that wasn't bright pink.
She just sort of looked at me and said "Neon string is pretty". I
suspect that Capetown hippies prioritize prettiness a lot more than me.
</p>
<p>
She got a bit exasperated with us by the end.  I think she was upset
that we came to her house and ate her pizza and didn't think she was
being cool.  She finally said "My god, don't you understand?  It's all
about being empowered!", to which Rory replied "But I don't need to be
empowered, I'm male."  She sort of looked at him for ten seconds, and
then left.
</p>
<p>
At this stage, we decided we should probably leave, too, so we went to
the Long Street Festival.  Apparently there is a street in Capetown that
is long, and it is called Long Street, and they had a Festival on it on
Friday night.  They shut the whole road off, and had music and alcohol
and stuff.
</p>
<p>
The first thing we did when we got there was verbally abuse the skateboarders that were doing
demonstrations on a half-pipe in the street.  We were loudly enquiring
as to why they were so kak, and whether they had meant to fall off their
skateboards.  Rory eventually hustled us off after
a bit of that, and we found a marching drum band, which we joined.  It
was actually very awesome, toyi-toyi-ing down Long Street surrounded by
hippies playing drums.  They didn't seem to mind that we joined them,
and it was great fun.  We had a police escort and everything.  One thing
that was quite weird was that at one stage, this brass band sort of just
joined in.  They weren't there when we joined the drum band, and
suddenly there was a small coloured guy with a trumpet next to me, and
he didn't seem to be playing anything to do with what the drums were
doing.  Then his backup arrived, and they marched with us, and may or
may not have been playing with the drummers - it didn't sound like it to me.
</p>
<p>
The place was swarming with Capetonians, and they were all weird. The thing that stood
out for me was seeing two Capetonians walking together: one had a shirt
that very clearly said "Support your local Soldiers For Jesus motorcycle
club", and the other one's shirt very clearly said "I was born with nothing, and I
still have fuck-all".
</p>
<p>
After that we moved further down the street and watched a fashion-show
thing which was utterly unimpressive, so we moved on and watched some
bands.
</p>
<p>
I really don't understand Capetonians.  The band we watched had won the
Battle of the Bands, so you'd think they'd be good, right?  Well, the
lead singer had this bright purple wig, and white paint all over his
face (I think he was a him, although he was rather Marilyn-Mansonly
androgynous, and she could have just been an incredibly ugly woman), and
was dressed like the artist formerly known as "The Artist Formerly Known
As Prince".  The bassist had a weird Twiggy style side-parting and was
wearing a horrible tuxedo, and the drummer had a big fedora on and a
Hitlerish mustache.  But the thing that really took the cake was the
frontman of the band, who had absolutely nothing to do with the music,
and didn't play a single instrument or sing a word.  He started off the
show bent over, presenting his very naked rear-end to the crowd.  I say
"very naked" because he had no clothes covering them.  He did, however,
have flowers in his bum.  And, yes, I said "in".  He then spent the rest
of the show wielding an axe vigorously at the crowd, and stomping around
the stage, but not in time to the music.  He was wearing a ski-mask, and
crotchless trousers (with a sort of loincloth thing thank god), and he
was covered in fake bloodstains, but you could actually see him pop to
the back of the stage in between songs to give himself a few more
squirts from the tomato sauce bottle.  You will be glad to know that he
removed the flowers from his nether parts, although you won't be so glad
to know that he used his axe to chop them up and shower the audience
with the resulting pot-pourri (although the smell was not as pleasant as
that normally associated with pot-pourri).
</p>
<p>
I promise you, the above description is deadly accurate.
</p>
<p>
On Saturday, we went to watch the UCT Rag floats parade, which I thought was silly.  After we'd had a
beer or two and watched that, we moved on to Stones and then to Cornerhouse, which is the most
awesomely fantastically disgusting and manky club you've ever seen.
They have carpets on the walls, but not on the floor, and you can't
actually see anything except the vague outline of the bartender in the
UV light.  I also discovered that they sell wine in,
like, pints.  Tassenberg, nogal.
</p>
<p>
Adeline came to find me after her shift, and we sat outside talking, then she drove
me home and bought me a pie. I shall buy her a small South American country when I have saved up enough.
</p>
<p>
At this stage I had vaguely begun to wonder if/when I would be returning
to Stellenbosch, and how I would get there.  It wasn't that much of an
issue yet, since there was still a braai at somebody's house on Sunday,
which turned into a game of Pictionary.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Bryony drove me back to Stellenbosch.  I eventually
arrived home at 8pm,  so tired, so dirty, so sore, so smelly, so broke, and so happy...
</p>
<p>
It was a damn fine weekend is the point I'm trying to make.  Although
since I spent most of it in the clothes I wore to work on Friday, they
took a bit of a beating.  My executive work pant got torn.
