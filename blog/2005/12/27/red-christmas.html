I've kinda held off blogging for a bit, because I wanted to properly finish writing about California, but then I just didn't have the time or energy.  I had so many song titles to use, too!  Ah, well.  Sometime, when I get round to it, I will write up one of the seminars that I went to at ISPCon, though - I found it interesting.

It's the day after Boxing Day, which should be a public holiday, if the government were playing by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_ball#Differences_between_UK_and_US">UK pool rules</a>, but nooo, they don't carry public holidays.  Pah. I'm waiting for <a href="http://gallery.omnia.za.net/f/tom">Tom</a> and his girlfriend Michelle to come down to Stellenbosch for dinner.  I haven't seen him since about 2002, and I'm really looking forward to it.

Christmas was, well, Christmas.  The usual, you know.  For New Years, I'm going up to Joburg to see <a href="http://gallery.omnia.za.net/f/tim">Tim</a> and the Family girls, which I am really looking forward to.  Some of the Family girls were down a week or so ago, actually, and we went <a href="http://gallery.omnia.za.net/v/vhata/FamilyWineRoute2005/">wine tasting</a> and <a href="http://gallery.omnia.za.net/v/vhata/FamilyOutingChristmas2005/">Out in Cape Town</a>, which was excellent.

Anyway, just checking in.  If you watch this space, and if I have time, you might get to see me ponder about the Corporation Part Two, Religion, Narrative and Identity, and AliceBot.  But I doubt it.
