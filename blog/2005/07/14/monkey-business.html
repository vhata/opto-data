<a href="http://god.myblog.co.za/">Guy</a> (Taylor, not Halse) has already <a href="http://god.myblog.co.za/node/view/142">nabbed</a> the Beatles lyric about monkeys, so I had to think up some other pun for the title of this entry. I haven't excelled myself, but it'll do.

On #crypt on the reaper.org SILC server, we're having our own version of celebrity deathmatch, as an indirect result of a challenge thrown at me to prove that one person was objectively more stupid than another (although my well known theory ("People Are Dof") has much supporting evidence) .  Certain individuals on the channel have been chosen as monkeys, and Guy, Peter and I are their handlers, to see how they do. Think of it as a social experiment. Guy has <a href="http://god.myblog.co.za/node/view/142">posted the rules of the contest</a>. Personally, I think my monkey, Patrick from XSInet, has it in the bag.
