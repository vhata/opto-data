<blockquote>
It's coming through a hole in the air,<br />
from those nights in Tiananmen Square.<br />
It's coming from the feel<br />
that this ain't exactly real,<br />
or it's real, but it ain't exactly there.<br />
From the wars against disorder,<br />
from the sirens night and day,<br />
from the fires of the homeless,<br />
from the ashes of the gay:<br />
Democracy is coming to the R.S.A.<br />
<br />
It's coming through a crack in the wall;<br />
on a visionary flood of alcohol;<br />
from the staggering account<br />
of the Sermon on the Mount<br />
which I don't pretend to understand at all.<br />
It's coming from the silence<br />
on the dock of the bay,<br />
from the brave, the bold, the battered<br />
heart of Chevrolet:<br />
Democracy is coming to the R.S.A.<br />
<br />
It's coming from the sorrow in the street,<br />
the holy places where the races meet;<br />
from the homicidal bitchin'<br />
that goes down in every kitchen<br />
to determine who will serve and who will eat.<br />
From the wells of disappointment<br />
where the women kneel to pray<br />
for the grace of God in the desert here<br />
and the desert far away:<br />
Democracy is coming to the R.S.A.<br />
<br />
Sail on, sail on<br />
O mighty Ship of State!<br />
To the Shores of Need<br />
Past the Reefs of Greed<br />
Through the Squalls of Hate<br />
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on.<br />
<br />
It's coming to South Africa first,<br />
the cradle of the best and of the worst.<br />
It's here they got the range<br />
and the machinery for change<br />
and it's here they got the spiritual thirst.<br />
It's here the family's broken<br />
and it's here the lonely say<br />
that the heart has got to open<br />
in a fundamental way:<br />
Democracy is coming to the R.S.A.<br />
<br />
It's coming from the women and the men.<br />
O baby, we'll be making love again.<br />
We'll be going down so deep<br />
the river's going to weep,<br />
and the mountain's going to shout Amen!<br />
It's coming like the tidal flood<br />
beneath the lunar sway,<br />
imperial, mysterious,<br />
in amorous array:<br />
Democracy is coming to the R.S.A.<br />
<br />
Sail on, sail on ...<br />
<br />
I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean<br />
I love the country but I can't stand the scene.<br />
And I'm neither left or right<br />
I'm just staying home tonight,<br />
getting lost in that hopeless little screen.<br />
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags<br />
that Time cannot decay,<br />
I'm junk but I'm still holding up<br />
this little wild bouquet:<br />
Democracy is coming to the R.S.A.<br />
<br />
<h4>Almost by Leonard Cohen</h4>
