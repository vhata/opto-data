I am heading up to Joburg tomorrow, for the prizegiving of the National Finals of the Innovation Fund.  Together with Jason Penton and a chap from Fort Hare, I was on the team that won the regional competition last year, in Grahamstown.  This qualified us to go up for the finals, which should be good. I get a free plane ticket there and back, and lodging in the City Lodge in Bryanston.  I will also see all the <a href="http://russell.rucus.net/2005/linuxworld/">RUCUS Linuxworld Geeks</a> (who are, as I type this, out having beer with Jon "Maddog" Hall, no less), and I will get to spend the weekend with <a href="http://gallery.omnia.za.net/f/tim">Tim</a> and all the Family girls! Hurrah!

Back on Sunday afternoon.
