To my surprise, not many people outside of Zimbabwe know about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blair_Toilet">Blair Toilet</a>. This revolutionary design for a long-drop toilet was developed at the <a href="http://www.blair.co.zw">Blair Research Institute</a> for mass deployment in the rural areas of Zimbabwe, where diseases such as cholera and typhoid were rife. The toilet is easy to construct, but its design makes it very clean, hygienic, and free of flies.  It is described <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12285911&dopt=Abstract">here</a> as "[using] little or no flush system, [being] odorless, free of insects, and [doubling] as a bathroom." There is a description of the mechanism <a href="http://www.tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=574&lang=English">here</a>, but the basic idea is that the pit underneath the toilet has a chimney or vent - warm air rises out of this chimney, taking the smells and flies with it. There is also a sort of valve system created by the doorway and the positioning of the vent which means that flies always attempt to fly the wrong way, trapping themselves further.

The pure genius of the system inspired a doctor friend of mine to write the following:

<h3>Ode to the Blair Toilet (or: Privy Paean)</h3>
<h4>By Charl Oettle, 1982</h4>
<br />
You may sit upon this privy<br />
Looking neat and clean and spivvy<br />
And may wonder where the flies and odours went<br />
Yes, the whole place smells of jasmine<br />
And each fly is now a has-been<br />
They've been flummoxed by the privy with the vent.<br />
<br />
In the old days every toilet<br />
(Though one tried so hard to foil it)<br />
Smelled and reeked and ponged enough to make one faint,<br />
And the flies bred out in dozens<br />
With their uncles, aunts and cousins<br />
And to use such privies one need be a saint.<br />
<br />
Any other lesser mortal<br />
As he staggered through the portal<br />
Would break out in language loud and short and strong,<br />
And to atavistic howls<br />
He'd evacuate his bowels<br />
Swatting flies and holding noses in the pong.<br />
<br />
But these troubles now are ended<br />
As the privy has been vented<br />
And it's looking rather good and clean and fresh (tra la la);<br />
In the sun the vent gets hotter,<br />
And it sucks out quite a lotter<br />
Smells and flies that bump their heads against the mesh.<br />
<br />
Having flown so quick and nimbly<br />
Up the hot and foetid chimbly<br />
Now their brains and hopes are dashed and will is spent,<br />
And they die, now ten, now twenty,<br />
In their cesspit horn of plenty -<br />
Vindication for the privy with the vent!<br />
<br />
