As mentioned last year, I <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/blog/archives/25-To-be-a-Saffie.html">applied</a> for determination of South African citizenship, but the application <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/blog/archives/37-BI-529-Saffie.html">took a lot longer than expected</a> and then <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/blog/archives/45-A-Saffie-to-be-continued....html">stalled</a>.  I ended up actually being the go-between for three different Home Affairs departments, one in Grahamstown, one in Paarl, and one in Pretoria.  I literally phoned them, took messages, and passed those messages on to the other departments.  My determination finally came through in about May, and it said that I was not eligible.  Then the next day, apparently, it said I was.  I'm not sure how it works, but all I know is that I can apply for citizenship. My grandparents are citizens, so I have to actually apply on my father's behalf, and then apply on my own behalf, through my father.  Anyway, I have finally scraped all the paperwork together, and sent it in, and they said it'll come through in six months.  That's February next year.  Bated breath is with what I wait. Soon I can be <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/blog/archives/56-PSA-Wannabe.html">PSA</a>?
