Grahamstown is coming alive again.  It's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_King">Fisher King</a><a href="#notfisherking">[1]</a>, dude.  The arcane rituals needed to cure the king and return the land to life from the barren <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waste_Land">Wasteland</a> to the living thing that it should be...
</p>

Anyway, yes.  It's coming back alive.  <a href="http://singe.rucus.net/">Dom</a> arrived back today, and we all had a braai at <a href="http://russell.rucus.net/">Russell's</a> house, which was very cool.  After that we went out, and people were there.  Like, real people.  It was good.

<a name="notfisherking">[1]</a><i>This article sucks.</i>  I have so much more to say about the Fisher King, and Arthurian Legend, and the Wasteland, and all that.  It's the one thing I really go moggy for. If you give a damn at all, <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> for it and find out the amazingness that is the Fisher King myth.
