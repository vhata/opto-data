The South African blogosphere was a little <a href="http://www.joblog.co.za/2005/01/comparing_apple.html">unhappy</a> that the <a href="http://2005.bloggies.com/">Bloggies</a> (public awards for good blogs) lump Africa and the Middle-East together in one category.  As a result, <a href="http://www.cherryflava.com/">CherryFlava</a> is putting together <a href="http://www.cherryflava.com/cherryflava/2005/01/the_south_afric.html">the South African blog awards</a>.  Stroll over there and contribute!
