<h3>Get Behind Thee, Satan</h3>
<h4>By <a href="http://www.thehighsociety.co.za/">High Society</a></h4>
Running through checkers, jumping and hopping<br />
Raise your arms and drop your shopping!<br />
Let's throw some Che Guevara styles,<br />
And start a revolution in the aisles!<br />
They will never take us alive,<br />
We'll take control of till number five.<br />
We'll make our motives understood,<br />
Raising riot till they lower the prices of canned goods!<br />
Singing stirring anthems for a brave new land,<br />
With a gun in one hand and some Omo in the other hand<br />
Fighting the struggle like Nkosazana Zuma<br />
We'll show them what it means to be a militant consumer<br />
Like Lenin, Castro and Chairman Mao<br />
Let's bag our freedom now!<br />
<br />
Because society is like a sick oil spillage<br />
Coming to your village, to rape and pillage<br />
Breaking all the vows that you're making, forsaken<br />
Get behind thee, Satan.  Get behind thee, Satan!<br />
<br />
Existential dilemma can be remedied<br />
All you need is a notebook and some cali weed<br />
I write ridiculous rhymes, it's all my fault:<br />
I don't have to leave my room to revolt.<br />
I'm revolting... Against your attitude<br />
I find it insulting - it makes me rude<br />
So, good luck to all you empty-headed ravers,<br />
And let's just hope that God will save us<br />
From these conglomerates of investment bankers<br />
Dealers, lawyers, pushers and wankers<br />
Masturbating on the human race<br />
Concentrating on the telly rate<br />
But I just relax<br />
And pay my tax<br />
And watch the world collapse<br />
<br />
Because, society is like a sick oil spillage<br />
Coming to your village, to rape and pillage<br />
Breaking all the vows that you're making, forsaken<br />
Get behind thee, Satan.  Get behind thee, Satan!<br />
<br />
