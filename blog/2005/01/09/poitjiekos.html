We made poitjie up at <a href="http://cliff.rucus.net/blog/">cliff</a>'s house at Stoneshill yesterday - was very successful.  We made two huge poitjies, one chicken and one beef, and even for all the people that were there, we didn't manage to finish them.  We started at about four in the afternoon, and gave the food a good long to get good and poit'ed.

I'd very much like to get me one of those poitjie-pots and do this more often - it's an excellent way to eat food.

The rest of the night was great - after everybody else went out, we sat and listened to Insane Clown Posse and Fatboy Slim and drank piet-piet-piet-and-jaco (a.k.a. Four Cousins) wine.  A good evening.

We got some videos (Jackie Brown, and Cruel Intentions, again) to watch, but didn't get around to it, so we're going to go up and watch them now.
