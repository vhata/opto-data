On Monday, I went down to Stellenbosch.  I popped in at <a href="http://www.adept.co.za/">Adept</a> and saw Gideon and Jac.  They didn't have the contract ready yet, so no signage has been done, but I did get to speak to them about This and That. My thesis is due in on the 15th of February, but they want me there on the 1st of February. Obviously I am trying my damnedest to get it done as soon as possible, but I'm a bit worried that I won't have it done by the time they want me there.  I'm going to keep them updated on my progress, however, and we'll see how things go.  I really don't want to rush the last part of the thesis, though. That would suck.

Better news, however: I have found a place to live in Stellenbosch. We had a look at a few flats and suchlike, and I realised that I am most definitely Not A Flat Person.  Don't like 'em. Horrible bare clinical prison-type items.  Sies.  Anyway, I've found a room in a house. It's just under 2km from where Adept are now (although they're moving, although they're not sure where to), so easily walkable, and the walk is straight through the pretty part of campus, anyway. I'm living with a lady and her son and his four friends, who are in second year at <a href="http://www.sun.ac.za/">Stellenbosch University</a>.  So, at least I'm living with people. They're male people, admittedly, but better than nothing.  It's a very nice house - large room, got a swimming pool and a braai and a TV with DSTV and all that. It's also much cheaper than the flats were, and includes lights and water in the rent, bo.  The only drawback (apart from the unknown factor of the digsmates) is that there is no laundry in the house, so I'll have to find a laundromat or something.
