My New Years was... different.  I was going to spend it with <a href="http://www.xanga.com/carxmoss">Claire</a> and <a href="http://www.xanga.com/adstix">Adeline</a>, but the former was sick and the latter was working, and it didn't pan out, so <a href="http://www.ee.uct.ac.za/people/WTRKAL001.php">Kalen</a> and I went with his girlfriend Meg to one of her workmates houses for cocktails, and then to Stones for a few drinks, and then to a party in Camps Bay.
</p>
<p>
Now, this Camps Bay party was on 53 Victoria Drive, but none of us had ever been there.  We were going to meet Adele, another friend of Meg's. We finally found the road, and found number 53, and found parking closish, and went and rang the bell on the door.  The door opened, we went in, got introduced to everybody, shown where the drinks were, and so on.  It was a great party. After about a while, however, we realised that we didn't know a single soul there, and that Adele wasn't there either.  After some enquiry, we discovered that we were at 53 Bantry Bay, and that our party was some little way down the road.  So eventually, we left, and went to the real party, where Kalen got drunk and tried to tell his toast joke.

I still think the first party was better.
