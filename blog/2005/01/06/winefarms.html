I have to mention this.
</p>
<p>
After Stellenbosch, we carried on through to Worcester, where some friends of ours have a wine farm, where we stayed for dinner.

<p>
I <b>picked</b> my own supper! When we got there, Edmund was just popping down to the river to check the water level, so he gave us a bowl each and led us down to the fields where we grabbed some tomatoes, lettuce, herbs, etc etc, as well as all the grapes we could eat.  And with the supper we had wine made by him, with cheese and olives, grown on his own farm! It was awesome.  And this is not some crappy plonk wine, this is awesome export quality stuff.  Even better than Tassies.

And here's the thing.  After supper, he showed us his brandy still.  He makes brandy, see.  And he showed us where he distills the wine, and where it goes, and how it works.  Then he took us through to the back room, where the brandy is casked.  These are huge wooden casks, like you see in movies and suchlike - they can hold 600 litres each.  And there were 140 of them in the room!  Some of them were almost ten years old, I believe.  And the brandy was amazing, too, not your Klipdrift that you drink with your Kola.  The final thing was that when the brandy is made, it comes out at 70% alcohol.  They have to water it down about half-half before they can sell it.  So, I was standing in a room with 140 barrels of 600 litres of 70% brandy.  That comes to 168000 litres of sellable brandy, or 224000 bottles of brandy, that I was looking at.
