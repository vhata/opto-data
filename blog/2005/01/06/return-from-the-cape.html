I returned from Capetown yesterday, flying with <a href="http://www.kulula.com">Kulula</a> once more. I tell you, they have different jokes every single time.
</p>
<p>
Capetown was okay.  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't fantastic, but I enjoyed myself there.  It was nice to see my family again, as well as various Capetown friends.  And I even managed to get a good chunk of writeup done.  Gaby kept me entertained with SMSes, and Knoppix was my saviour as far as software was concerned.  Fatboy Slim was essential.

I climbed Lion's Head last week, and Table Mountain this week, with <a href="http://viktoria.rucus.net/">Viktoria</a>, and I can still feel the throbbing heat of sunburn on the back of my neck.  But I got all the way to the top, right across, and all the way down.  That makes me officially Hardcore (tm).  Viktoria didn't even break a sweat or lose her breath, damn her.

Christmas was okay.  I got two coffee filters.

And now it's just thesis thesis thesis.
