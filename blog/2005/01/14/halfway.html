<h3><a href="http://vhata.net/stuff/halfway">Halfway down the stairs</a></h3>
<h4>By A. A. Milne</h4>
Halfway down the stairs<br />
Is a stair where I sit:<br />
There isn't any other stair quite like it.<br />
I'm not at the bottom,<br />
I'm not at the top:<br />
So this is the stair where I always stop.<br />
<br />
Halfway up the stairs<br />
Isn't up, and isn't down.<br />
It isn't in the nursery, it isn't in the town:<br />
And all sorts of funny thoughts<br />
Run round my head:<br />
"It isn't really anywhere! It's somewhere else instead!"<br />
