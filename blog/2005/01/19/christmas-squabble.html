<h1>THE GAME OF CHRISTMAS SQUABBLE</h1>
<p>
Christmas Squabble is the classic game of family domination for all ages.
</p>
<h2>Objective.</h2>
<p>
Each player struggles for world domination while obstructing his fellow
competitors from achieving their objectives at every turn. Play takes place
in the house, divided into <b>LOUNGE</b>, <b>KITCHEN</b>, and <b>BEDROOMS</b> (where contestants
are permitted to play their <b>SOB CARDS</b>). The defence of these territories   
must be planned carefully, or victory may soon be turned to defeat. Heavy  
casualties may result in the loss of <b>CHRISTMAS SQUABBLE</b>.
</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>
Each player starts the game with the following: Two Chips (shoulder), Six
Petty Grievances, Three Sour Grapes, Four Major resentments, Two Annoying
Habits.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>: All <b>MAJOR RESENTMENTS</b> must remain unspoken until the final round,
just when things seem to be settling down. The first player to produce them
from his sleeve at this crucial juncture will thus gain <b>TEMPORARY SUPREMACY</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>TIP FOR PLAY</b>: Take care to <b>NURSE</b> your <b>SIX PETTY GRIEVANCES</b> throughout
<b>CHRISTMAS SQUABBLE</b>, so that they are fighting fit when you find yourself in
a position to reveal them.
</p>
<h2>Dice</h2>
<p>
Before the commencement of <b>CHRISTMAS SQUABBLE</b>, all dice should be declared
lost. The third player then repeats the following phrase: "Why is it always
me who has to look for everything?" four times before play commences. Six   
months after close of play, the dice may be found <b>EITHER</b> under the sofa <b>OR</b> 
in the drawer full of keys/plugs/used batteries/screwdrivers/used glue tubes
etc in the kitchen corner next to the cooker.
</p>
<h2>Preparing to play</h2>
<p>
Before the game commences, each player elects him/herself The General. The
General is in charge of everyone else, and must control the other
contestants at all times. <b>WARNING</b>: Having elected yourself The General, be  
careful not to inform anyone else too soon, or they may immediately bring
into play one of their <b>MAJOR RESENTMENTS</b>. Remove all jokers. Now shuffle all
the queens and make sure any pairs are separated.
</p>
<h2>
Setting up forces
</h2>
<p>
Each player of <b>CHRISTMAS SQUABBLE</b> enters the game having first formed a
<b>SECRET ALLIANCE</b>. A Secret Alliance is formed either by whispering <b>EITHER</b>
"Well, someone had to tell her" <b>OR</b> "Frankly, I don?t blame you one little
bit" <b>OR</b> "He told me not to tell anyone else, but ...".
</p>
<p>
These alliances may be broken at any time during the game by repeating the
words, "That's the last time I tell you a secret".
</p>
<h2>
Claiming the higher ground
</h2>
<p>
<b>KITCHEN (SINK SIDE)</b>: Any player found in the kitchen (sink side) may be
tackled by The General with the words "You couldn't be a dear and ...". He or
she will then suffer the forfeit of being given <b>EITHER</b> a bag of Brussels
sprouts and a blunt knife <b>OR</b> five dirty pans and the scrappy remains of a  
Brillo pad.
</p>
<p>
<b>KITCHEN (SETTEE SIDE)</b>:  Players taking refuge on the kitchen settee must
repeat the phrase: "You'll have to turn over - it's the EastEnders Christmas
Omnibus." This allows other players to <b>FLOUNCE OUT</b> and claim one new <b>PETTY
GRIEVANCE</b> per player.
</p>
<p>
<b>BEDROOM</b>: Any player <b>FLOUNCING OUT</b> must immediately retreat to their bedroom
and slam the door. On hearing an upstairs bedroom door slammed, any player
remaining in the <b>KITCHEN</b> must sigh: "I turn my back for five minutes and ..."
thereby <b>CLAIMING THE HIGHER GROUND</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>NEW HALL/UTILITY ROOM/GARAGE</b>: These will be included in later editions of   
<b>CHRISTMAS SQUABBLE</b>.
</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
Combat commences at the stroke of 11 o'clock on Christmas morning. Player
One passes the first present to Player Two on his left. Player Two opens it,
finds it is a <b>SHREDDER</b>, and attempts to <b>STIFLE HIS DISAPPOINTMENT</b>. Player
One says: "You can always change it if you don't like it." Player Two   
replies "I didn't say I didn't like it." Player Three can now step in and
say: "Well, you don't sound very grateful!" To beat Player Two, Player Three
must give Player Two a box of chocolate nut and raisins (with the nuts taken
out) and something slightly lavendary. Player Three now awaits his response.
If Player Two is unable to smile and say thank you, he must retire from the
game of <b>CHRISTMAS SQUABBLE</b>.
</p>
<h2>Manoeuvre</h2>
<p>
Once he has completed all his attacks, a player may conduct <b>ONE</b> manoeuvre. 
Each player may move from room to room, but only: 
<ol type="a">
<li>to avoid another player or players,</li>
<li>to exchange <b>PETTY GRIEVANCES</b>, or</li>
<li>to take it out on Kitten.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Winning</h2>
<p>
The winner is the player left in the behind in the <b>LOUNGE</b> with the TV remote
control, and who has not gone off in the huff. He declares his victory by 
shouting "AND ANOTHER THING!" before slumping into a prolonged doze.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
We have to decide if we play ordinary <b>CHRISTMAS SQUABBLE</b> or another version.
It is also available in an <b>EXECUTIVE EDITION</b>, including disappointing
Christmas crackers, presquashed satsumas, a whoopee cushion and five paper 
crowns which have come apart at the seam.
</p>
<p>
Or maybe we should splash out on the <b>LUXURY DELUXE EDITION</b>, which includes
all the above, plus an oven roasted turkey, still frozen towards the centre
