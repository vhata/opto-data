Happy New Year anoll.
</p>
<p>
I went to Joburg for New Years, to see <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/photos/tim">Tim</a> and the Family girls.  Let me tell you a bit about my holiday.
</p>
<p>
We went out for Thai food on Thursday night, and for drinks on Friday night, where I saw Avri, which was nice. The main event, however, was Saturday, of course. For this, we went to Makro and bought <a href="http://www.droogle.ca/">ingredients</a> for Pino Coladas, Strawberry Daiquiris, Mojitos, and Frozen Margaritas. I'd like to say for the record that as we were walking out of Makro, for the first time ever, I could actually see myself living in Joburg, being a real person, and living a real life. Not now, not soon, but one day, maybe.
</p>
<p>
A bunch of people came round to Tim's complex (named "Graceland", for some reason. I couldn't find any fat, dead singers on the toilets, but still...), and we made cocktails and swam and played volleyball and had a braai.  It was good.  I took lots of really awesome photos. Then I put my camera down to let Avri and Cindy out the gate, and ten seconds later, when I went to pick it up again, it was gone.  That was US$350 worth of excellent camera, and a whole bunch of priceless photographs. We were in the common area of the complex, so it could have been anyone from the area. Most unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
After the braai, we all trooped round to <a href="http://god.myblog.co.za/">Guy Taylor</a>'s parents' house for the actual New Year's party. The house was absolutely massive, two swimming pools anoll. Very good. After screwing up my introduction to his mother (just because his surname is Taylor doesn't mean hers is), we went outside. His parents and their friends were being quiet and civilised inside. At one point, I decided I needed to go to the bathroom, so went inside. Now, the main thing about glass is that its see-through. That's the point of glass. That's why we use it. But why would you make a door out of glass? Honestly? It's just asking for trouble. Anyway, after I had recovered from a near-broken nose, wrung most of the red wine out of my shirt, apologised to the surprised adults on the other side of the door, and returned to the party outside, very embarrassed. Most unfortunate.
<p>
Just before twelve, we were invited to go upstairs for the countdown. Midnight came and went, as it tends to do. We then went back outside, whereupon <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/gallery/v/FamilyNewYears2005/Toni.jpg.html">Toni</a> decided that I needed to go into the pool. I grabbed the nearest thing I could to stop myself going in, which was a tree.  No, it wasn't a tree.  It was a <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/gallery/v/FamilyNewYears2005/ThatBloodyPotplant.jpg.html">bloody great pot plant</a>. So there was soil all over the pool, and I was <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/gallery/v/FamilyNewYears2005/ToniJonathanWet.jpg.html">sodden</a>, as were my phone and wallet, which had been in my pocket. R.I.P. phone. Most unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
Finally, on our way out, I was trailing wet clothes everywhere, and they have a tendency to catch onto things. I don't know whether it was a two thousand year old Ming vase, or just a glass bowl, but it went *pangalangalang* in a most heart-rending way as it hit the driveway. Most unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
By Monday, I was ready to just get home, please, with no further incident. So Tim drove me to the airport, where we discovered that I'd missed my flight. Most unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
I managed to get on standby, and got home in the end.  Also, my phone started working two days later, although it was too late as I'd already bought another one. All in all, the weekend gets a 9, though, it really was fantastic. Thanks to <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/gallery/v/FamilyNewYears2005/MeganSerious.jpg.html">Megan</a> for the photos. She, too, by the way, is absolutely fantastic.
</p>
<p>
To round off the whole episode, Tim got his car stolen from Rivonia on Thursday night, with two sets of golf clubs, a Nokia hands-free kit, a CD rack, and his ID book in it.  Which really sucks.
</p>
<p>
In other news, I have just handed my thesis in.
