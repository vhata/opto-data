My RSS feeds recently turned up the following two entries, which juxtapose each other interestingly:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/blair.asp">Measure for measure</a>.  Tony Blair's quotation about how a good way to judge that America was still a good country was by comparing how many people wanted in with how many people wanted out.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/10/23/getting_out_your_gui.html">Getting out: your guide to leaving America</a>. Mark Ehrman's guide to leaving America.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update:</b> <i>Ask Slashdot</i> asks <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/10/24/1810233">where Americans would go</a>, if they left.
