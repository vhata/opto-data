A year ago today, on the 20th of February, 2005, I arrived by bus in the small town of Stellenbosch.  My new boss, Gideon, picked me up from the bus-stop and took me for breakfast, and then to my new house. The next day, I started my first day of real work, in a real job.

<p>
It was quite a momentous occasion for me - I had spent seven years at Rhodes, outlasting almost everybody that I knew, and settling so deep into Grahamstown life that I could hardly imagine not being a part of it any more.  Looking back, I am nothing but glad that I left - I have escape the rut that others have fallen into, and expanded in many areas.  I miss the Good Old Days of Grahamstown, but life in Stellenbosch has its own attractions and its own charm.  I've learned a lot, made many new friends, had many good times, and I'm generally pleased with the way it's turned out.

To a good year, and to many more, whereever they be!
