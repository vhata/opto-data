<h3>Owning Everything</h3>
<h4>by Leonard Cohen</h4>
<br />
For your sake I said I will praise the moon,<br />
tell the colour of the river,<br />
find new words for the agony<br />
and ecstacy of gulls.<br />
<br />
Because you are close,<br />
everything that men make, observe<br />
or plant is close, is mine:<br />
the gulls slowly writhing, slowly singing<br />
on the spears of wind;<br />
the iron gate above the river;<br />
the bridge holding between stone fingers<br />
her cold bright necklace of pearls.<br />
<br />
The branches of shore trees,<br />
like trembling charts of rivers,<br />
call the moon for an ally<br />
to claim their sharp journeys<br />
out of the dark sky,<br />
but nothing in the sky responds.<br />
The branches only give a sound<br />
to miles of wind.<br />
<br />
With your body and your speaking<br />
you have spoken for everything,<br />
robbed me of my strangerhood,<br />
made me one<br />
with the root and gull and stone, <br />
and because I sleep so near to you<br />
I cannot embrace<br />
or have my private love with them.<br />
<br />
You worry that I will leave you.<br />
I will not leave you.<br />
Only strangers travel.<br />
Owning everything,<br />
I have nowhere to go.<br />
