Maybe you and her can go to Mike's Kitchen together.<br />
And have a themed birthday.<br />
And have Bubblegum Milkshakes.<br />
And get some clown to make you animal shapes from balloons.<br />
And then you and her can promise to get married when you move out from your respective parents' homes.<br />
And maybe become Blood Buddies.<br />
Until she goes off to another school across town.<br />
And meets up with a rugby player called Biff.<br />
Who has a license.<br />
And has a brother that's old enough to buy beer.<br />
And then you'll be cross.<br />
And you'll throw your bicycle down some stairs.<br />
And drink so much Cherry Cola that you throw up.<br />
All over yourself.<br />
Then you'll see her and Biff and Biff's brother Chuck.<br />
Driving down the main road.<br />
Laughing the carefree laugh.<br />
Of drunk people in love.<br />
Then we'll see.<br />
