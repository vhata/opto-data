The difference between an atheist and a theist is that one believes in the supernatural, and one does not.  How, then, can you base your arguments on the supernatural?  That is begging the question.  That argument would go as follows:

I believe in the supernatural, and my proof is as follows:
1. The supernatural exists
2. ...
Ergo,
The supernatural exists.

This is clearly fallacious.  In order for an atheist and a theist to engage in rational debate, they need to start from shared premises, and work towards a conclusion they can both agree on.
