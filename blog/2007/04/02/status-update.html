Just an update on where I am and what I'm doing.  I am no longer working at <a href="http://www.adept.co.za/">Adept Internet</a> - I have moved to <a href="http://www.openvoice.co.za/">OpenVoice</a>, and today was my first day.
</p>
<p>
Adept is based in Stellenbosch, but OpenVoice's offices are in Millenium Park in Century City.  As a result, I am moving from Stellenbosch to Cape Town, and I'm renting a place in Kenilworth - this means that I'm swimming upstream mostly, when I drive to and from work.  I haven't actually moved house yet - I only signed the lease on Saturday.  I spent last night in the Rondebosch Safehouse, and will probably stay in Stellenbosch tonight.  I'll move sometime in the next week or so, although <a href="http://gallery.omnia.za.net/v/vhata/Harties/123_You.jpg.html">Megan</a>'s single main request for her holiday in Cape Town this week is that she spend some time in Stellenbosch.  I'm taking Thursday off work (my fourth day, I know!), so that should be fine.
</p>
<p>
Today started off with insomnia, and then lost car keys.  I left home at 7am ("Leave early", they said. "You don't want to be late on your first day", they said) and got to work at 7:25am.  Everybody else rocked up at about 8:45am, which meant that I had a solid hour and twenty minutes to get really well acquainted with the parking lot at our offices.  (It's a very nice parking lot, by the way.)
</p>
<p>
This job seems interesting, with a nice environment, and lots of opportunity, and I'm looking forward to it.  In addition, I now get to live in the Mother City proper, about which I am very excited.  Onward, 2007!
