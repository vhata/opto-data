Having just started a new job, and moved to a new town, I find that I have a different outlook on things.  I find that after waking up in the mornings, and getting ready for work, I stop and look around me, and pause for a few seconds to cast my mind back over the previous day, and consider the possibilities open to me for the new day, and I ask myself the question that we all find ourselves faced with at some stage in our lives:
</p>
<p>
Where the hell are my keys?
</p>
<p>
No, seriously, every single day of work so far (that's only two days, in total, but still) has started with me losing my keys.  Yesterday morning, they were down the side of the couch, but I still haven't found them since I noticed they were missing this morning (I have spares).  But it's not just my keys, either - I discovered on Friday that my British passport and South African ID book were not where they usually live, which is in a special place <a href="http://gallery.omnia.za.net/v/vhata/Houses/60JonkershoekDesk1.jpg.html">on my desk</a>, just to the left of a pile of blank CDs, in front of my Tazo collection, and sort of to the right of the bowl I used for my breakfast.  The passport has since turned up tucked into an envelope full of Ubuntu Dapper CDs that I haven't touched since I received it in about August (I last saw my passport in February).  I'm sure the keys and ID book are somewhere in this flat, but I've ransacked it high and low, and can't find them.  I expect that they will turn up inside the bread bin, or behind the toilet cistern, or possibly taped to the underside of the icebox in my fridge.  Until then, I soldier through my grief.

<b>Update:</b> WHO PUTS THEIR KEYS IN THE POCKET OF THEIR BAG WHEN ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS WALK INSIDE AND PLACE THEM ON THE TABLE?  Anyway, thanks, St Francis.  See what you can do about my ID now?
