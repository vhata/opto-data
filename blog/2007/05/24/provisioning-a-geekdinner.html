With four days left until <a href="http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Cape_Town_May_2007">the next GeekDinner</a>, there's a lot of last minute stuff that has needed to be done. However, we have succeeded in organising <a href="http://www.getwine.co.za/">GetWine</a> as the wine sponsor, <a href="http://nxsy.org/">Neil</a> has found a projector, and we have <a href="http://www.prosperis.com/">Prosperis technologies</a> possibly sponsoring the sound system.  We've confirmed the speakers (apart from <a href="http://www.jerith.za.net/">Jeremy</a> who hasn't decided what he's going to speak on), and we've got pretty close to our target of 70 attendees.
</p>
<p>
All that remains now is for you to <a href="http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Cape_Town_May_2007">sign up</a>, if you're interested and haven't done so already, and ahead we go.

(If you're in the Garden Route, there's a <a href="http://www.feistyfemale.com/index.php/2007/05/21/garden-route-geek-dinner/">GeekDinner being held there, too</a>.)
