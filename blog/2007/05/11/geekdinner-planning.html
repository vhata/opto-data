Since the planning for the second GeekDinner seemed to stall a bit, I decided it needed a kickstart, and after a bit of discussion with <a href="http://nxsy.org/">Neil</a>, got in touch with <a href="http://www.thewildfig.co.za/">The Wild Fig</a> restaurant in Mowbray/Observatory.  <a href="http://www.swimgeek.com/">Joe</a> and I went round there at the beginning of this week to make arrangements, and after a bit of haggling and discussion, we have settled on a date.

<p>
So, the <a href="http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Cape_Town_May_2007">next GeekDinner</a> will be held at the Wild Fig on Monday the 28th of May, at 18h30 for 19h00.  Please head along to the wiki page (at <a href="http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Cape_Town_May_2007">http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Cape_Town_May_2007</a>), and sign up.  If you're keen to give a talk, let us know!
