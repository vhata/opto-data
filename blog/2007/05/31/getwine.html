Just a note:  the wine at the last <a href="http://vhata.net/blog/2007/05/30/may-geekdinner">GeekDinner</a> was sponsored by <a href="http://www.getwine.co.za/">GETWINE</a>.  That's <a href="http://www.getwine.co.za/">GETWINE.co.za</a>, not getwine.com.  Yes, I'm talking to <a href="http://generation7.wordpress.com/2007/05/30/geekdinner/">you</a>, <a href="http://www.g7.org.za/">Antoine</a> ;-).

The wine itself was very pleasant, and was provided, all thirty-six bottles worth, free to us by the nice people at GetWine.  Apart from their generosity, they are very cheap, and have excellent service - <a href="http://nxsy.org">Neil</a> ordered a case of wine from them a day or two ago, and received it, delivered to his office, <b>three or four hours later</b>.  <a href="http://www.getwine.co.za/">Try them</a>.
