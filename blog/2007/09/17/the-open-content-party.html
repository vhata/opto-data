On Saturday, we had <a href="http://vhata.net/blog/2007/09/05/heather-and-jimmy-wales-party-on-software-freedom-day">the Open Content Party</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> and <a href="http://hblog.org/">Heather Ford</a>.  I won't say much, since <a href="http://teepog.blogspot.com/2007/09/tale-of-50-cities.html">Arno</a> and <a href="http://halcyonpage.blogspot.com/2007/09/eyes-wide-open.html">Christel</a> have both given rather good roundups of the atmosphere at the place, and I can't really top that.  It was a great evening, with all sorts of people bring what they could.  <a href="http://gallery.omnia.za.net/v/vhata/GeekEvents/OpenContentParty/">Photos</a> are up.

See you all at the <a href="http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Cape_Town_September_2007">GeekDinner</a> next week!
