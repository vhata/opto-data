Jimmy Wales (the founder of <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>) and <del>his wife</del> Heather <ins>Ford from iCommons in Johannesburg</ins> have hatched a scheme to hold 50 parties in 50 cities around the world, with an Open Content/Creative Commons/Free Software sort of theme.  You can read about it <a href="http://www.icommons.org/nodes/heather-and-jimmys-50-great-parties-club">at iCommons</a> or on <a href="http://50parties.wikia.com/">Wikia</a>, but what I'm most interested in is the <a href="http://50parties.wikia.com/wiki/1_of_50%2C_Cape_Town">Cape Town party</a>, which is happening in a week and a half's time, on <a href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/">International Software Freedom Day</a>.

Jimbo Wales will be here, and it should be good.  It's at Deer Park Cafe in Vredehoek - head over to the <a href="http://50parties.wikia.com/wiki/1_of_50%2C_Cape_Town">wikia page</a> and sign up!

<b>Updated</b> - I have no idea why I thought Heather was Jimbo's wife.
