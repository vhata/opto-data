Once again, it's time for a <a href="http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Main_Page">Cape Town GeekDinner</a>.  The next one - dubbed <a href="http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Cape_Town_November_2007">Eccentric Eggplant</a> - is being held upstairs at Ferryman's at the Waterfront, this Wednesday (the 28th of November), at about 7pm.  We're getting sponsored wine from <a href="http://www.wine23.co.za/">Wine23.co.za</a>, and there are some talks which look quite interesting.
</p>
<p>
Something new that's happening at this GeekDinner is the <strong>Slideshow Karaoke</strong>.  Bryn Divey and I are the victims in this case - we will be presenting two talks based on slides written by Russell Cloran and Jeremy Thurgood.  We will not have seen the slides before, nor will we even know what subject they are on, until we start presenting the talk.  It should be interesting, at the very least.
</p>
<p>
And then, of course, there's the *camp coming up.  We're still struggling a little bit with the <a href="http://wiki.geekdinner.org.za/wiki/Star_Camp/Cape_Town_2007/Venue">venue</a>, although we have some good offers.  Please, go look at the wiki, and come along!
