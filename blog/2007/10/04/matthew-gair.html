My friend <a href="http://www.myspace.com/matthewgair">Matthew Gair</a> has recently produced an album of his awesome songs, which you can buy and download from <a href="http://www.amiestreet.com/">Amie Street</a>.  It's really great stuff - have a listen here:

</p>
<p>
And go buy <a href="http://www.amiestreet.com/matthewgair">here!</a>.  It is, of course, DRM free.  Downloads on Amie Street start out free, and go up by half a cent every time somebody buys it...
