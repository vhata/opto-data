A recent mail from <a href="http://nxsy.org/">Neil</a> to the <a href="http://lists.geekdinner.org.za/mailman/listinfo/starcamp-planning">StarCamp planning mailing list</a> outlines what the current state is for StarCamp:

<blockquote>
In case you were late and missed the previous email, we have a great
venue at AIMS in Muizenburg.  They're giving us a bunch of rooms on
their ground floor, but they have some simple rules and requirements
from us.  But we should be able to have a good event there.  We need
some volunteers to man the doors and sign people in.  We'll have some
help from people at AIMS, but we should try be as little an
inconvenience to them as possible.<br />
<br />
We have T-shirts being made by Quirk.  We have free lunch on both days
provided by Sentient Communications.  We have name tags and stickers
from AlterSage.  We have free drinks provided by the Western Cape
Linux User Group.  AIMS has connectivity, so we won't be using Amobia,
but they'd be there if they were needed.  Hopefully ProsperIS will
cover the last-minute minutiae of infrastructure that AIMS doesn't
have for us.  We're in good shape in this department.<br />
<br />
We have 21 talks/events offered over two days, as well as at least 4
others I'm trying to finalise.  My expectation is that a few people
will drop out at the last minute, but I think we're covered.<br />
<br />
Our problem is that we only have 67 people signed up to attend.  We
have lunch for quite a few more people available.  I'd hate for that
lunch to go to waste.<br />
<br />
<strong>CALL TO ACTION:</strong> So, the most important thing over these last two days
before the event for you to do is invite people to attend StarCamp.
Get them to sign up on the main event page (ie, not only on Facebook,
if at all possible).  Blog about it.  Mention it to user groups you're
part of.  Mention it to your colleagues.<br />
<br />

So, tell your friends, have a look at <a href="http://www.starcamp.org.za/">the wiki page</a>, come along, and hope to see you there!
