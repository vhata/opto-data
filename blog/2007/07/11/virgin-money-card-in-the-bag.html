I got an SMS today.

If this surprises you, read <a href="http://vhata.net/blog/2007/07/09/virgin-money-and-uti-a-study-in-inefficiency">this</a> and <a href="http://vhata.net/blog/2007/07/10/virgin-money-reads-my-blog">this</a>.

The SMS was from UTi couriers, telling me that they would be delivering my card today, and I should have proof of residence, proof of income (bank statements or payslip), and a copy of my ID.  This led to a frantic search for my passport, which I could not find for a good half an hour.  It turned up inside the bag that Tom used to wrap the bottle of Jack Daniels that he gave me for my 21st birthday in 2001.  Obviously.  (Okay, I can hear you all judging me, I've learned my lesson.)  As it turns out, I have a copy of my ID anyway, so I didn't need it.

Anyway, the UTi chappie arrived, and I signed all sorts of bits of paper, and now I have my card.  Remind me to put any other problems I have up on the Intartubes, too.

(I'd just like to add that, once the problem had actually been sorted out, Virgin Money were very efficient and apologetic and all that.  So, good on them and stuff.)
