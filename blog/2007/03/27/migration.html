I have just about finished the migration from my old site on <a href="http://vhata.rucus.net/">http://vhata.rucus.net/</a> to this new system.  Unfortunately, I can't bring my <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vhata">googlerank</a> with me, but hopefully that will build up in time.

There's still a bunch of stuff that I'd like to add to this site, but it has the functionality necessary to carry on with for now.  Time will tell if I ever do get around to fixing it.

Anyway, this is just a quick blog entry to nudge my RSS feed back into life.
