Yesterday, I was involved in a rehash of the age-old gripe about <a href="http://www.clug.org.za/">CLUG</a> being Linux-centric.  To give you an idea of how long this has been going on, I submit a statement made in <a href="http://wiki.clug.org.za/wiki/Statement_13-01-2000_Name_Change">January 2000</a>.
</p>
<p>
The discussion started around whether or not attending <a href="http://www.geekdinner.org.za/">GeekDinner</a> and/or <a href="http://wiki.clug.org.za/wiki/CLUG_Meetings">CLUG meetings</a> was beneficial.  One argument against CLUG meetings was that 
<blockquote>
most of this stuff, it's easier for me to read up on, or in the case of ZFS, actually have running myself. So a talk on it, while nice, is superfluous to requirements
</blockquote>
My response to that is quite simply that these things are more about meeting people and networking than actually benefitting from the talks.  This brings me back to the point I made 
<a href="http://vhata.net/blog/2007/03/29/geekdinner">yesterday</a>, and which <a href="http://www.nickcoyne.com/">Nick Coyne</a> has <a href="http://www.nickcoyne.com/wp/2007/03/30/geekdinner/">agreed with</a> - small tables aren't conducive to networking. But I digress.
</p>
<p>
My antagonist said that meeting people wasn't desirable, because the only people you'd meet would be CLUG people, "Linux weenies", who exclude FreeBSD, Solaris, Irix, etc, and go "Linux or nothing!".  I didn't think that any of us <b>were</b> "Linux or nothing", but when I mentioned this, I was referred to the "L" in the name "CLUG".
</p>
<p>
So, I hereby propose a name change, to <b>CDG/LVUGSFLOSSOSOCE</b>: the Cape Debian Gnu/Linux and Variants User Group Supporting Free and Libre Open Source Software, Open Standards,
 Open Content, and <a href="http://lists.clug.org.za/pipermail/clug-chat/2005-November/017995.html">Evolution</a>.
