	What was they cannot take away.
	Within, the words behind us live again,
	So when the world without is cold to us,
	Be sure that what you lived is somewhere near.
	We cannot touch it, cannot reach inside, for time
	Has fled beyond us to that hidden place
	Where passing days retire for evermore.
	But close your eyes, recall the words,
	The music or the scent you heard or knew,
	Then see, behind the dimness of your eyes
	The faded sepia, moving hours,
	Imperishable, re-enactments breathe,
	And thoughts unspoken never fade away
